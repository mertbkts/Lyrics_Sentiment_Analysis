1,"there was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before in the parts of cairo, a merchant named tj al-dn who was of the most considerable of the merchants and of the chiefs of the freeborn. but he was given to travelling everywhere and loved to fare over wild and wold, waterless lowland and stony waste, and to journey to the isles of the seas, in quest of dirhams and dinars: wherefore he had in his time encountered dangers and suffered duresse of the way such as would grizzle little children and turn their black hair grey. he was possessed of black slaves and mamelukes, eunuchs and concubines, and was the wealthiest of the merchants of his time and the goodliest of them in speech, owning horses and mules and bactrian camels and dromedaries; sacks great and small of size; goods and merchandise and stuffs such as muslins of hums, silks and brocades of ba'allak, cotton of mery, stuffs of india, gauzes of baghdad, burnouses of moorland and turkish white slaves and abyssinian castratos and grecian girls and egyptian boys; and the coverings of his bales were silk with gold purfled fair, for he was wealthy beyond compare. furthermore he was rare of comeliness, accomplished in goodliness, and gracious in his kindliness, even as one of his describers doth thus express, ""a merchant i spied whose lovers  were fighting in furious guise: quoth he, 'why this turmoil of people?'  quoth i, 'trader, for those fine eyes!'"" and saith another in his praise and saith well enough to accomplish the wish of him, ""came a merchant to pay us a visit  whose glance did my heart surprise: quoth he, 'what surprised thee so?'  quoth i, 'trader, 'twas those fine eyes.'"" now that merchant had a son called ali nur al-din, as he were the full moon whenas it meeteth the sight on its fourteenth night, a marvel of beauty and loveliness, a model of form and symmetrical grace, who was sitting one day as was his wont, in his father's shop, selling and buying, giving and taking, when the sons of the merchants girt him around and he was amongst them as moon among stars, with brow flower-white and cheeks of rosy light in down the tenderest dight, and body like alabaster-bright even as saith of him the poet, ""'describe me!' a fair one said.  said i, 'thou art beauty's queen.' and, speaking briefest speech,  'all charms in thee are seen.'"" and as saith of him one of his describers, ""his mole upon plain of cheek is like  ambergrs-crumb on marble plate, and his glances likest the sword proclaim  to all love's rebels 'the lord is great!'"" the young merchants invited him saying, ""o my lord nur al-din, we wish thee to go this day a-pleasuring with us in such a garden."" and he answered, ""wait till i consult my parent, for i cannot go without his consent."" as they were talking, behold, up came taj al-din, and his son looked at him and said, ""o father mine, the sons of the merchants have invited me to wend a-pleasuring with them in such a garden. dost thou grant me leave to go?"" his father replied, ""yes, o my son, fare with them;"" and gave him somewhat of money. so the young men mounted their mules and asses and nur al-din mounted a she-mule and rode with them to a garden, wherein was all that sould desireth and that eye charmeth. it was high of walls which from broad base were seen to rise; and it had a gateway vault-wise with a portico like a saloon and a door azure as the skies, as it were one of the gates of paradise: the name of the door-keeper was rizwn, and over the gate were trained an hundred trellises which grapes overran; and these were of various dyes, the red like coralline, the black like the snouts of sdn-men and the white like egg of the pigeon-hen. and in it peach and pomegranate were shown and pear, apricot and pomegranate were grown and fruits with and without stone hanging in clusters or alone,and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-fourth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the sons of the merchants entered the vergier, they found therein all that soul desireth or eye charmeth, grapes of many hues grown, hanging in bunches or alone, even as saith of them the poet, ""grapes tasting with the taste of wine  whose coats like blackest raven's shine: their sheen, amid the leafage shows,  like women's fingers henna'd fine."" and as saith another on the same theme, ""grape-bunches likest as they sway  a-stalk, my body frail and snell: honey and water thus in jar,  when sourness past, make hydromel."" then they entered the arbour of the garden and say there rizwan the gate-keeper sitting, as he were rizwan the paradise-guardian, and on the door were written these lines, ""garth heaven-watered wherein clusters waved  on boughs which full of sap to bend were fain: and, when the branches danced on zephyr's palm,  the pleiads shower'd as gifts fresh pearls for rain."" and within the arbour were written these two couplets, ""come with us, friend, and enter thou  this garth that cleanses rust of grief: over their skits the zephyrs trip  and flowers in sleeve to laugh are lief."" so they entered and found all manner fruits in view and birds of every kind and hue, such as ringdove, nightingale and curlew; and the turtle and the cushat sang their love lays on the sprays. therein were rills that ran with limpid wave and flowers suave; and bloom for whose perfume we crave and it was even as saith of it the poet in these two couplets, ""the zephyr breatheth o'er its branches, like  fair girls that trip as in fair skirts they pace: its rills resemble swords in hands of knights  drawn from the scabbard and containing-case."" and again as singeth the songster, ""t he streamlet swings by branchy wood and aye  joys in its breast those beauties to display; and zephyr noting this, for jealousy  hastens and bends the branches other way."" on the trees of the garden were all manner fruits, each in two sorts, amongst them the pomegranate, as it were a ball of silver-dross, whereof saith the poet and saith right well, ""granados of finest skin, like the breasts  of maid firm-standing in sight of male; when i strip the skin, they at once display  the rubies compelling all sense to quail."" and even as quoth another bard, ""close prest appear to him who views th' inside  red rubies in brocaded skirts bedight: granado i compare with marble dome  or virgin's breasts delighting every sight: therein is cure for every ill as e'en  left an hads the prophet pure of sprite; and allah (glorify his name) eke deigned  a noble say in holy book indite. the apples were the sugared and the musky and the dmni, amazing the beholder, whereof saith hassan the poet, ""apple which joins hues twain, and brings to mind  the cheek of lover and beloved combined: two wondrous opposites on branch they show  this dark and that with hue incarnadined the twain embraced when spied the spy and turned  this red, that yellow for the shame designed."" there also were apricots of various kinds, almond and camphor and jlni and 'antbi, wereof saith the poet, ""and almond-apricot suggesting swain  whose lover's visit all his wits hath ta'en. enough of love-sick lovers' plight it shows  of face deep yellow and heart torn in twain."" and saith another and saith well, ""look at that apricot whose bloom contains  gardens with brightness gladding all men's eyne: like stars the blossoms sparkle when the boughs  are clad in foliage dight with sheen and shine."" there likewise were plums and cherries and grapes, that the sick of all diseases assain and do away giddiness and yellow choler from the brain; and figs the branches between, varicoloured red and green, amazing sight and sense, even as saith the poet, ""'tis as the figs with clear white skins outthrown  by foliaged trees, athwart whose green they peep, were sons of roum that guard the palace-roof  when shades close in and night-long ward they keep."" and saith another and saith well, ""welcome the fig! to us it comes  ordered in handsome plates they bring: likest a surfah-cloth we draw  to shape of bag without a ring."" and how well saith a third, ""give me the fig sweet-flavoured, beauty-clad,  whose inner beauties rival outer sheen: and when it fruits thou tastest it to find  chamomile's scent and sugar's saccharine: and eke it favoureth on platters poured  puff-balls of silken thread and sendal green."" and how excellent is the saying of one of them, ""quoth they (and i had trained my taste thereto  nor cared for other fruits whereby they swore), 'why lovest so the fig?' whereto quoth i  'some men love fig and others sycamore.'"" and are yet goodlier those of another, ""pleaseth me more the fig than every fruit  when ripe and hanging from the sheeny bough; like devotee who, when the clouds pour rain,  sheds tears and allah's power doth avow."" and in that garth were also pears of various kinds sinatic, aleppine and grecian growing in clusters and alone, parcel green and parcel golden.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-fifth night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the merchants' sons went down into the garth they saw therein all the fruits we mentioned and found pears sinatic, aleppine and grecian of every hue, which here clustering there single grew, parcel green and parcel yellow to the gazer a marvel-view, as saith of them the poet, ""with thee that pear agree, whose hue a-morn  is hue of hapless lover yellow pale; like virgin cloistered strait in strong harm  whose face like racing steed outstrips the veil."" and sultani peaches of shades varied, yellow and red, whereof saith the poet, ""like peach in vergier growing  and sheen of andam showing: whose balls of yellow gold  are dyed with blood-gouts flowing."" there were also green almonds of passing sweetness, resembling the cabbage of the palm-tree, with their kernels within three tunics lurking of the munificent king's handiworking, even as is said of them, ""three coats yon freshest form endue  god's work of varied shape and hue: hardness surrounds it night and day;  prisoning without a sin to rue."" and as well saith another, ""seest not that almond plucked by hand  of man from bough where wont to dwell: peeling it shows the heart within  as union-pearl in oyster- shell."" and as saith a third better than he, ""how good is almond green i view!  the smallest fills the hand of you: its nap is as the down upon  the cheeks where yet no beardlet grew: its kernels in the shell are seen,  or bachelors or married two, as pearls they were of lucent white  casd and lapped in jasper's hue."" and as saith yet another and saith well, ""mine eyes ne'er looked on aught the almond like  for charms, when blossoms in the prime show bright: its head to hoariness of age inclines  the while its cheek by youth's fresh down is dight."" and jujube-plums of various colours, grown in clusters and alone whereof saith one, describing them, ""look at the lote-tree, note on boughs arrayed  like goodly apricots on reed-strown floor, their morning-hue to viewer's eye is like  cascavels cast of purest golden ore."" and as saith another and saith right well, ""the jujube-tree each day  robeth in bright array. as though each pome thereon  would self to sight display. like falcon-bell of gold  swinging from every spray."" and in that garth grew blood oranges, as they were the khaulanjn, whereof quoth the enamoured poet, ""red fruits that fill the hand, and shine with sheen  of fire, albe the scarf-skin's white as snow. 'tis marvel snow on fire doth never melt  and, stranger still, ne'er burns this living lowe!"" and quoth another and quoth well, ""a nd trees of orange fruiting ferly fair  to those who straitest have their charms surveyed; like cheeks of women who their forms have decked  for holiday in robes of gold brocade."" and yet another as well, ""like are the orange-hills when zephyr breathes  swaying the boughs and spray with airy grace, her cheeks that glow with lovely light when met  at greeting- tide by cheeks of other face."" and a fourth as fairly, ""and fairest fawn, we said to him 'portray  this garth and oranges thine eyes survey:' and he, 'your garden favoureth my face  who gathereth orange gathereth fire alway.'"" in that garden too grew citrons, in colour as virgin gold, hanging down from on high and dangling among the branches, as they were ingots of growing gold; and saith thereof the 'namoured poet, ""hast seen a citron-copse so weighed adown  thou fearest bending roll their fruit on mould; and seemed, when zephyr passed athwart the tree  its branches hung with bells of purest gold?"" and shaddocks, that among their boughs hung laden as though each were the breast of a gazelle-like maiden, contenting the most longing wight, as saith of them the poet and saith aright, ""and shaddock mid the garden-paths, on bough  freshest like fairest damsel met my sight; and to the blowing of the breeze it bent  like golden ball to bat of chrysolite."" and the lime sweet of scent, which resembleth a hen's egg, but its yellowness ornamenteth its ripe fruit, and its fragrance hearteneth him who plucketh it, as saith the poet who singeth it, ""seest not the lemon, when it taketh form,  catch rays of light and all to gaze constrain; like egg of pullet which the huckster's hand  adorneth dyeing with the saffron-stain?"" moreover in this garden were all manner of other fruits and sweet-scented herbs and plants and fragrant flowers, such as jessamine and henna and water-lilies and spikenard and roses of every kind and plantain and myrtle and so forth; and indeed it was without compare, seeming as it were a piece of paradise to whoso beheld it. if a sick man entered it, he came forth from it like a raging lion, and tongue availeth not to its description, by reason of that which was therein of wonders and rarities which are not found but in heaven: and how should it be otherwise when its doorkeeper's name was rizman? though widely different were the stations of those twain! now when the sons of the merchants had walked about gazing at the garden after taking their pleasure therein, they say down in one of its pavilions and seated nur al-din in their midst.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-sixth night, she resume, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the sons of the merchants sat down in the pavilion they seated nur al-din in their midst on a rug of gold-purfled leather of al-tif, leaning on a pillow of minever, stuffed with ostrich down. and they gave him a fan of ostrich feathers, whereon were written these two couplets, ""a fan whose breath is fraught with fragrant scent;  minding of happy days and times forspent, wafting at every time its perfumed air  o'er face of noble youth on honour bent."" then they laid by their turbands and outer clothes and sat talking and chatting and inducing one another to discourse, while they all kept their eyes fixed on nur al-din and gazed on his beauteous form. after the sitting had lasted an hour or so, up came a slave with a tray on his head, wherein were platters of china and crystal containing viands of all sorts (for one of the youths had so charged his people before coming to the garden); and the meats were of whatever walketh earth or wingeth air or swimmeth waters, such as kat-grouse and fat quails and pigeon-poults and mutton and chickens and the delicatest fish. so, the tray being sat before them, they fell to and ate their fill; and when they had made an end of eating, they rose from meat and washed their hands with pure water and musk-scented soap, and dried them with napery embroidered in silk and bugles; but to nur al-din they brought a napkin laced with red gold whereon he wiped his hands. then coffee was served up and each drank what he would, after which they sat talking, till presently the garden-keeper who was young went away and returning with a basket full of roses, said to them, ""what say ye, o my masters, to flowers?"" quoth one of them, ""there is no harm in them, especially roses, which are not to be resisted."" answered the gardener, ""'tis well, but it is of our wont not to give roses but in exchange for pleasant converse; so whoever would take aught thereof, let him recite some verses suitable to the situation."" now they were ten sons of merchants of whom one said, ""agreed: give me thereof and i will recite thee somewhat of verse apt to the case."" accordingly the gardener gave him a bunch of roses which he took and at once improvised these three couplets, ""the rose in highest stead i rate  for that her charms ne'er satiate; all fragrant flow'rs be troops to her  their general of high estate: where she is not they boast and vaunt;  but, when she comes, they stint their prate."" then the gardener gave a bunch to another and he recited these two couplets, ""take, o my lord, to thee the rose  recalling scent by mush be shed. like virginette by lover eyed  who with her sleeves enveileth head."" then he gave a bunch to a third who recited these two couplets, ""choice rose that gladdens heart to see her sight;  of nadd recalling fragrance exquisite. the branchlets clip her in her leaves for joy,  like kiss of lips that never spake in spite."" then he gave a bunch to a fourth and he recited these two couplets, ""seest not that rosery where rose a-flowering displays  mounted upon her steed of stalk those marvels manifold? as though the bud were ruby-stone and girded all around  with chrysolite and held within a little hoard of gold."" then he gave a posy to a fifth and he recited these two couplets, ""wands of green chrysolite bare issue, which  were fruits like ingots of the growing gold. and drops, a dropping from its leaves, were like  the tears my languorous eyelids railed and rolled."" then he gave a sixth a bunch and he recited these two couplets, ""o rose, thou rare of charms that dost contain  all gifts and allah's secrets singular, thou'rt like the loved one's cheek where lover fond  and fain of union sticks the gold dinar."" then he gave a bunch to a seventh and he recited these two couplets, ""to rose quoth i, 'what gars thy thorns to be put forth  for all who touch thee cruellest injury?' quoth she, 'these flowery troops are troops of me  who be their lord with spines for armoury.'"" and he gave an eighth a bunch and he recited these two couplets, ""allah save the rose which yellows a-morn  florid, vivid and likest the nugget-ore; and bless the fair sprays that displayed such fowers  and mimic suns gold-begilded bore."" then he gave a bunch to a ninth and he recited these two couplets, ""the bushes of golden-hued rose excite  in the love-sick lover joys manifold: 'tis a marvel shrub watered every day  with silvern lymph and it fruiteth gold."" then he gave a bunch of roses to the tenth and last and he recited these two couplets, ""seest not how the hosts of the rose display  red hues and yellow in rosy field? i compare the rose and her arming thorn  to emerald lance piercing golden shield."" and whilst each one hent bunch in hand, the gardener brought the wine-service and setting it before them, on a tray of porcelain arabesqued with red gold, recited these two couplets, ""dawn heralds day-light: so wine pass round,  old wine, fooling sage till his wits he tyne: wot i not for its purest clarity  an 'tis wine in cup or 'tis cup in wine."" then the gardener filled and drank and the cup went round, till it came to nur al-din's turn, whereupon the man filled and handed it to him; but he said, ""this thing i wot it not nor have i ever drunken thereof, for therein is great offence and the lord of all-might hath forbidden it in his book."" answered the gardener, ""o my lord nur al-din, an thou forbear to drink only by reason of the sin, verily allah (extolled and exalted be he!) is bountiful, of sufferance great, forgiving and compassionate and pardoneth the mortalest sins: his mercy embraceth all things, allah's ruth be upon the poet who saith, 'be as thou, wilt, for allah is bountiful  and when thou sinnest feel thou naught alarm: but 'ware of twofold sins nor ever dare  to give god partner or mankind to harm.'"" then quoth one of the sons of the merchants, ""my life on thee, o my lord nur al-din, drink of this cup!"" and another conjured him by the oath of divorce and yet another stood up persistently before him, till he was ashamed and taking the cup from the gardener, drank a draught, but spat it out again, crying, ""'tis bitter."" said the young gardener, ""o my lord nur al-din, knowest thou not that sweets taken by way of medicine are bitter? were this not bitter, 'twould lack of the manifold virtues it possesseth; amongst which are that it digesteth food and disperseth cark and care and dispelleth flatulence and clarifieth the blood and cleareth the complexion and quickeneth the body and hearteneth the hen-hearted and fortifieth the sexual power in man; but to name all its virtues would be tedious. quoth one of the poets, 'we'll drink and allah pardon sinners all  and cure of ills by sucking cups i'll find: nor aught the sin deceives me; yet said he  'in it there be advantage to mankind.'"" then he sprang up without stay or delay and opened one of the cupboards in the pavilion and taking out a loaf of refined sugar, broke off a great slice which he put into nur al-din's cup, saying, ""o my lord, an thou fear to drink wine, because of its bitterness, drink now, for 'tis sweet."" so he took the cup and emptied it: whereupon one of his comrades filled him another, saying, ""o my lord nur al-din, i am thy slave,"" and another did the like, saying, ""i am one of thy servants,"" and a third said, ""for my sake!"" and a fourth, ""allah upon thee, o my lord nur al-din, heal my heart!"" and so they ceased not plying him with wine, each and every of the ten sons of merchants till they had made him drink a total of ten cups. now nur al-din's body was virgin of wine-bibbing, or never in all his life had he drunken vine-juice till that hour, wherefore its fumes wrought in his brain and drunkenness was stark upon him and he stood up (and indeed his tongue was thick and his speech stammering) and said, ""o company, by allah, ye are fair and your speech is goodly and your place pleasant; but there needeth hearing of sweet music; for drink without melody lacks the chief of its essentiality, even as saith the poet, 'pass round the cup to the old and the young man, too, and take the bowl from the hand of the shining moon, but without music, i charge you, forbear to drink; i see even horses drink to a whistled tune.'"" therewith up sprang the gardener lad and mounting one of the young men's mules, was absent awhile, after which he returned with a cairene girl, as she were a sheep's tail, fat and delicate, or an ingot of pure silvern ore or a dinar on a porcelain plate or a gazelle in the wold forlore. she had a face that put to shame the shining sun and eyes babylonian and brows like bows bended and cheeks rose-painted and teeth pearly-hued and lips sugared and glances languishing and breast ivory white and body slender and slight, full of folds and with dimples dight and hips like pillows stuffed and thighs like columns of syrian stone, and between them what was something like a sachet of spices in wrapper swathed. quoth the poet of her in these couplets, ""had she shown her shape to idolaters' sight,  they would gaze on her face and their gods detest: and if in the east to a monk she'd show'd,  he'd quit eastern posture and bow to west. an she crached in the sea and the briniest sea  her lips would give it the sweetest zest."" and quoth another in these couplets, ""brighter than moon at full with kohl'd eyes she came  like doe, on chasing whelps of lioness intent: her night of murky locks lets fall a tent on her  a tent of hair that lacks no pegs to hold the tent; and roses lighting up her roseate cheeks are fed  by hearts and livers flowing fire for languishment: an 'spied her all the age's fair to her they'd rise  humbly, and cry 'the meed belongs to precedent!'"" and how well saith a third bard, ""three things for ever hinder her to visit us, for fear of the intriguing spy and eke the rancorous envier; her forehead's lustre and the sound of all her ornaments and the sweet scent her creases hold of ambergris and myrth. grant with the border of her sleeve she hide her brow and doff her ornaments, how shall she do her scent away from her?"" she was like the moon when at fullest on its fourteenth night, and was clad in a garment of blue, with a veil of green, overbrown flower-white that all wits amazed and those of understanding amated.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying his permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-seventh night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the gardener brought a girl whom we have described, possessed of the utmost beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetrical grace as it were she the poet signified when he said, ""she came apparelled in a vest of blue, that mocked the skies and shamed their azure hue; i thought thus clad she burst upon my sight, like summer moonshine on a wintry night."" and how goodly is the saying of another and how excellent, ""she came thick veiled, and cried i, 'o display  that face like full moon bright with pure-white ray.' quoth she, 'i fear disgrace,' quoth i, 'cut short  this talk, no shift of days thy thoughts affray.' whereat she raised her veil from fairest face  and crystal spray on gems began to stray: and i forsooth was fain to kiss her cheek,  lest she complain of me on judgment-day. and at such tide before the lord on high  we first of lovers were redress to pray: so 'lord, prolong this reckoning and review'  (prayed i) 'that longer i may sight my may.'"" then said the young gardener to her, ""know thou, o lady of the fair, brighter than any constellation which illumineth air we sought, in bringing thee hither naught but that thou shouldst entertain with converse this comely youth, my lord nur al-din, for he hath come to this place only this day."" and the girl replied, ""would thou hadst told me, that i might have brought what i have with me!"" rejoined the gardener, ""o my lady, i will go and fetch it to thee."" ""as thou wilt,"" said she: and he, ""give me a token."" so she gave him a kerchief and he fared forth in haste and returned after awhile, bearing a green satin bag with slings of gold. the girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it, whereupon there fell thereout two-and-thirty pieces of wood, which she fitted one into other, male into female and female into male till they became a polished lute of indian workmanship. then she uncovered her wrists and laying the lute in her lap, bent over it with the bending of mother over babe, and swept the strings with her finger-tips; whereupon it moaned and resounded and after its olden home yearned; and it remembered the waters that gave it drink and the earth whence it sprang and wherein it grew and it minded the carpenters who made it their merchandise and the ships that shipped it; and it cried and called aloud and moaned and groaned; and it was as if she asked it of all these things and it answered her with the tongue of the case, reciting these couplets, ""a tree whilere was i the bulbul's home  to whom for love i bowed my grass-green head: they moaned on me, and i their moaning learnt  and in that moan my secret all men read: the woodman fell me falling sans offence,  and slender lute of me (as view ye) made: but, when the fingers smite my strings, they tell  how man despite my patience did me dead; hence boon-companions when they hear my moan  distracted wax as though by wine misled: and the lord softens every heart of me,  and i am hurried to the highmost stead: all who in charms excel fain clasp my waist;  gazelles of languid eyne and houri maid: allah ne'er part fond lover from his joy  nor live the loved one who unkindly fled."" then the girl was silent awhile, but presently taking the lute in lap, again bent over it, as mother bendeth over child, and preluded in many different modes; then, returning to the first, she sang these couplets, ""would they the lover seek without ado,  he to his heavy grief had bid adieu: with him had vied the nightingale on bough  as one far parted from his lover's view: rouse thee! awake! the moon lights union-night  as tho' such union woke the morn anew. this day the blamers take of us no heed  and lute-strings bid us all our joys ensue. seest not how four-fold things conjoin in one  rose, myrtle, scents and blooms of golden hue. yea, here this day the four chief joys unite  drink and dinars, beloved and lover true: so win thy worldly joy, for joys go past  and naught but storied tales and legends last."" when nur al-din heard the girl sing these lines he looked on her with eyes of love and could scarce contain himself for the violence of his inclination to her; and on like wise was it with her, because she glanced at the company who were present of the sons of the merchants and she saw that nur al-din was amongst the rest as moon among stars; for that he was sweet of speech and replete with amorous grace, perfect in stature and symmetry, brightness and loveliness, pure of all defect, than the breeze of morn softer, than tasnim blander, as saith of him the poet, ""by his cheeks' unfading damask and his smiling teeth i swear, by the arros that he feathers with the witchery of his air, by his sides so soft and tender and his glances bright and keen, by the whiteness of his forehead and the blackness of his hair, by his arched imperious eyebrows, chasing slumber from my lids with their yeas and noes that hold me 'twixt rejoicing and despair, by the scorpions that he launches from his ringlet-clustered brows, seeking still to slay his lovers with his rigours unaware, by the myrtle of his whiskers and the roses of his cheek, by his lips' incarnate rubies and his teeth's fine pearls and rare, by the straight and tender sapling of his shape, which for its fruit doth the twin pomegranates, shining in his snowy bosom, wear, by his heavy hips that tremble, both in motion and repose, and the slender waist above them, all too slight their weight to bear, by the silk of his apparel and his quick and sprightly wit, by all attributes of beauty that are fallen to his share; lo, the musk exhales its fragrance from his breath, and eke the breeze from his scent the perfume borrows, that it scatters everywhere. yea, the sun in all his splendour cannot with his brightness vie and the crescent moon's a fragment that he from his nails doth pare."" and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-eighth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nur al-din was delighted with the girl's verses and he swayed from side to side for drunkenness and fell a-praising her and saying, ""a lutanist to us inclined  and stole our wits bemused with wine: and said to us her lute, 'the lord  bade us discourse by voice divine.'"" when she heard him thus improvise the girl gazed at him with loving eyes and redoubled in passion and desire for him increased upon her, and indeed she marvelled at his beauty and loveliness, symmetry and grace, so that she could not contain herself, but took the lute in lap again and sang these couplets, ""he blames me for casting on him my sight  and parts fro' me bearing my life and sprite: he repels me but kens what my heart endures  as though allah himself had inspired the wight: i portrayed his portrait in palm of hand  and cried to mine eyes, 'weep your doleful plight.' for neither shall eyes of me spy his like  nor my heart have patience to bear its blight: wherefore, will i tear thee from breast, o heart  as one who regards him with jealous spite. and when say i, 'o heart be consoled for pine,'  'tis that heart to none other shall e'er incline:"" nur al-din wondered at the charms of her verse and the elegance of her expression and the sweetness of her voice and the eloquence of her speech and his wit fled for stress of love and longing, and ecstasy and distraction, so that he could not refrain from her a single moment, but bent to her and strained her to his bosom: and she in like manner bowed her form over his and abandoned herself to his embrace and bussed him between the eyes. then he kissed her on the mouth and played with her at kisses, after the manner of the billing of doves; and she met him with like warmth and did with him as she was done by till the others were distracted and rose to their feet; whereupon nur al-din was ashamed and held his hand from her. then she took her lute and, preluding thereon in manifold modes, lastly returned to the first and sang these couplets, ""a moon, when he bends him those eyes lay bare  a brand that gars gazing gazelle despair: a king, rarest charms are the host of him  and his lance-like shape men with cane compare: were his softness of sides to his heart transferred  his friend had not suffered such cark and care: ah for hardest heart and for softest sides!  why not that to these alter, make here go there? o thou who accusest my love excuse:  take eternal and leave me the transient share."" when nur al-din heard the sweetness of her voice and the rareness of her verse, he inclined to her for delight and could not contain himself for excess of wonderment; so he recited these couplets. ""methought she was the forenoon sun until she donned the veil  but lit she fire in vitals mine still flaring fierce and high, how had it hurt her an she deigned return my poor salm  with fingertips or e'en vouchsafed one little wink of eye? the cavalier who spied her face was wholly stupefied  by charms that glorify the place and every charm outvie. 'be this the fair who makes thee pine and long for love liesse?  indeed thou art excused!' 'this is my fairest she;'(quoth i) who shot me with the shaft of looks nor deigns to rue my woes  of strangerhood and broken heart and love i must aby: i rose a-morn with vanquished heart, to longing love a prey  and weep i through the live long day and all the night i cry."" the girl marvelled at his eloquence and elegance and taking her lute, smote thereon with the goodliest of performance, repeating all the melodies, and sang these couplets, ""by the life o' thy face, o thou life o' my sprite!  i'll ne'er leave thy love for despair or delight: when art cruel thy vision stands hard by my side  and the thought of thee haunts me when far from sight: o who saddenest my glance albe weeting that i  no love but thy love will for ever requite? thy cheeks are of rose and thy lips-dews are wine;  say, wilt grudge them to us in this charming site?"" hereat nur al-din was gladdened with extreme gladness and wondered with the utmost wonder, so he answered her verse with these couplets, ""the sun yellowed not in the murk gloom li'en  but lay pearl enveiled 'neath horizon-chine; nor showed its crest to the eyes of morn  but took refuge from parting with morning-shine. take my tear-drops that trickle as chain on chain  and they'll tell my case with the clearest sign. an my tears be likened to nile-flood, like  malak's flooded flat be this love o'mine. quoth she, 'bring thy riches!' quoth i, 'come, take!'  'and thy sleep?' 'yes, take it from lids of eyne!'"" when the girl heard nur al-din's words and noted the beauty of his eloquence her senses fled and her wit was dazed and love of him gat hold upon her whole heart. so she pressed him to her bosom and fell to kissing him like the billing of doves, whilst he returned her caresses with successive kisses; but preeminence appertaineth to precedence. when she had made an end of kissing, she took the lute and recited these couplets, ""alas, alack and well-away for blamer's calumny!  whether or not i make my moan or plead or show no plea: o spurner of my love i ne'er of thee so hard would deem  that i of thee should be despised, of thee my property. i wont at lovers' love to rail and for their passion chide,  but now i fain debase myself to all who rail at thee: yea, only yesterday i wont all amourists to blame  but now i pardon hearts that pine for passion's ecstasy; and of my stress of parting-stowre on me so heavy weighs  at morning prayer to him i'll cry, 'in thy name, o ali!'"" and also these two couplets, ""his lovers said, 'unless he deign to give us all a drink  of wine, of fine old wine his lips deal in their purity; we to the lord of threefold worlds will pray to grant our prayer'  and all exclaim with single cry 'in thy name, o ali!'"" nur al-din, hearing these lines and their rhyme, marvelled at the fluency of her tongue and thanked her, praising her grace and passing seductiveness; and the damsel, delighted at his praise, arose without stay or delay and doffing that was upon her of outer dress and trinkets till she was free of all encumbrance sat down on his knees and kissed him between the eyes and on his cheek-mole. then she gave him all she had put off.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and sixty-ninth night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the girl gave to nur al-din all she had doffed, saying, ""o beloved of my heart, in very sooth the gift is after the measure of the giver."" so he accepted this from her and gave it back to her and kissed her on the mouth and cheeks and eyes. when this was ended and done, for naught is durable save the living, the eternal, provider of the peacock and the owl, nur al-din rose from the sance and stood upon his feet, because the darkness was now fallen and the stars shone out; whereupon quoth the damsel to him, ""whither away, o my lord?""; and quoth he, ""to my father's home."" then the sons of the merchants conjured him to night with them, but he refused and mounting his shemule, rode, without stopping, till he reached his parent's house, where his mother met him and said to him, ""o my son, what hath kept thee away till this hour? by allah, thou hast troubled myself and thy sire by thine absence from us, and our hearts have been occupied with thee."" then she came up to him, to kiss him on his mouth, and smelling the fumes of the wine, said, ""o my wine-bibber and a rebel against him to whom belong creation and commandment?"" but nur al-din threw himself down on the bed and lay there. presently in came his sire and said, ""what aileth nur al-din to lie thus?""; and his mother answered, ""'twould seem his head acheth for the air of the garden."" so taj al-din went up to his son, to ask him of his ailment, and salute him, and smelt the reek of wine. now the merchant loved not wine-drinkers; so he said to nur al-din, ""woe to thee, o my son! is folly come to such a pass with thee, that thou drinkest wine?"" when nur al-din heard his sire say this, he raised his hand, being yet in his drunkenness, and dealt him a buffet, when by decree of the decreer the blow lit on his father's right eye which rolled down on his cheek; whereupon he fell a-swoon and lay therein awhile. they sprinkled rose-water on him till he recovered, when he would have beaten his son; but the mother withheld him, and he swore, by the oath of divorce from his wife that, as soon as morning morrowed, he would assuredly cut off his son's right hand. when she heard her husband's words, her breast was straitened and she feared for he son and ceased not to soothe and appease his sire, till sleep overcame him. then she waited till moon-rise, when she went in to her son, whose drunkenness had now departed from him, and said to him, ""o nur al-din, what is this foul deed thou diddest with thy sire?"" he asked, ""and what did i with him?""; and answered she, ""thou dealtest him a buffet on the right eye and struckest it out so that it rolled down his cheek; and he hath sworn by the divorce-oath that, as soon as morning shall morrow he will without fail cut off thy right hand."" nur al-din repented him of that he had done, whenas repentance profited him naught, and his mother sait to him, ""o my son, this penitence will not profit thee; nor will aught avail thee but that thou arise forthwith and seek safety in flight: go forth the house privily and take refuge with one of thy friends and there what allah shall do await, for he changeth case after case and state upon state."" then she opened a chest and taking out a purse of an hundred dinars said, ""o my son, take these dinars and provide thy wants therewith, and when they are at an end, o my son, send and let me know thereof, that i may send thee other than these, and at the same time covey to me news of thyself privily: haply allah will decree thee relief and thou shalt return to thy home. and she farewelled him and wept passing sore, nought could be more. thereupon nur al-din took the purse of gold and was about to go forth, when he espied a great purse containing a thousand dinars, which his mother had forgotten by the side of the chest. so he took this also and binding the two purses about his middle, set out before dawn threading the streets in the direction of blk, where he arrived when day broke and all creatures arose, attesting the unity of allah the opener and went forth each of them upon his several business, to win that which allah had unto him allotted. reaching bulak he walked on along the riverbank till he sighted a ship with her gangway out and her four anchors made fast to the land. the folk were going up into her and coming down from her, and nur al-din, seeing some sailors there standing, asked them whither they were bound, and they answered, ""to rosetta-city."" quoth he, ""take me with you;"" and quoth they, ""well come, and welcome to thee, to thee, o goodly one!"" so he betook himself forthright to the market and buying what he needed of vivers and bedding and covering, returned to the port and went on board the ship, which was ready to sail and tarried with him but a little while before she weighed anchor and fared on, without stopping, till she reached rosetta, where nur al-din saw a small boat going to alexandria. so he embarked in it and traversing the sea-arm of rosetta fared on till he came to a bridge called al-jm, where he landed and entered alexandria by the gate called the gate of the lote-tree. allah protected him, so that none of those who stood on guard at the gate saw him, and he walked on till he entered the city.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventieth night, she resumed, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when nur al-din entered alexandria he found it a city goodly of pleasaunces, delightful to its inhabitants and inviting to inhabit therein. winter had fared from it with his cold and prime was come to it with his roses: its flowers were kindly ripe and welled forth its rills. indeed, it was a city goodly of ordinance and disposition; its folk were of the best of men, and when the gates thereof were shut, its folk were safe. and it was even as is said of it in these couplets, ""quoth i to a comrade one day,  a man of good speech and rare, 'describe alexandria.'  quoth he, 'tis a march-town fair.' quoth i, 'is there living therein?'  and he, 'an the wind blow there.'"" or as saith one of the poets, ""alexandria's a frontier; whose dews of lips are sweet and clear; how fair the coming to it is,  so one therein no raven speer!"" nur al-din walked about the city and ceased not walking till her came to the merchants' bazar, whence he passed on to the mart of the money-changers and so on in turn to the markets of the confectioners and fruiterers and druggists, marvelling, as he went, at the city, for that the nature of its qualities accorded with its name. as he walked in the druggists' bazar, behold, an old man came down from his shop and saluting him, took him by the hand and carried him to his home. and nur al-din saw a fair bystreet, swept and sprinkled, whereon the zephyr blew and made pleasantness pervade it and the leaves of the trees overshaded it. therein stood three houses and at the upper end a mansion, whose foundations were firm sunk in the water and its walls towered to the confines of the sky. they had swept the space before it and they had sprinkled it freshly; so it exhaled the fragrance of flowers, borne on the zephyr which breathed upon the place; and the scent met there who approached it on such wise as it were one of the gardens of paradise. and, as they had cleaned and cooed the by-street's head, so was the end of it with marble spread. the shaykh carried nur al-din into the house and setting somewhat of food before him ate with his guest. when they had made an end of eating, the druggist said to him, ""when camest thou hither from cairo?""; and nur al-din replied, ""this very night, o my father."" quoth the old man, ""what is thy name?""; and quoth he, ""ali nur al-din."" said the druggist, ""o my son, o nur al-din, be the triple divorce incumbent on me, an thou leave me so long as thou abidest in this city; and i will set thee apart a place wherein thou mayst dwell."" nur al-din asked, ""o my lord the shaykh, let me know more of thee""; and the other answered, ""know, o my son, that some years ago i went to cairo with merchandise, which i sold there and bought other, and i had occasion for a thousand dinars. so thy sire taj al-din weighed them out for me, all unknowing me, and would take no written word of me, but had patience with me till i returned hither and sent him the amount by one of my servants, together with a gift. i saw thee, whilst thou wast little; and, if it please allah the most high, i will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me."" when nur al-din heard the old man's story, he showed joy and pulling out with a smile the purse of a thousand dinars, gave it to his host the shaykh and said to him, ""take charge of this deposit for me, against i buy me somewhat of merchandise whereon to trade."" then he abode some time in alexandria city taking his pleasure every day in its thoroughfares, eating and drinking ad indulging himself with mirth and merriment till he had made an end of the hundred dinars he had kept by way of spending-money; whereupon he repaired to the old druggist, to take of him somewhat of the thousand dinars to spend, but found him not in his shop and took a seat therein to await his return. he sat there gazing right and left and amusing himself with watching the merchants and passers-by, and as he was thus engaged behold, there came into the bazar a persian riding on a she-mule and carrying behind him a damsel; as she were argent of alloy free or a fish balti in mimic sea or a doe-gazelle on desert lea. her face outshone the sun in shine and she had witching eyne and breasts of ivory white, teeth of marguerite, slender waist and sides dimpled deep and calves like tails of fat sheep; and indeed she was perfect in beauty and loveliness, elegant stature and symmetrical grace, even as saith one, describing her, ""'twas as by will of her she was create  nor short nor long, but beauty's mould and mate: rose blushes reddest when she sees those cheeks  and fruits the bough those marvel charms amate: moon is her favour, musk the scent of her  branch is her shape: she passeth man's estate: 'tis e'en as were she cast in freshest pearl  and every limblet shows a moon innate."" presently the persian lighted down from his she-mule and, making the damsel also dismount, loudly summoned the broker and said to him as soon as he came, ""take this damsel and cry her for sale in the market."" so he took her and leading her to the middlemost of the bazar disappeared for a while and presently he returned with a stool of ebony, inlaid with ivory, and setting it upon the ground, seated her thereon. then he raised her veil and discovered a face as it were a median targe or a cluster of pearls: and indeed she was like the full moon, when it filleth on its fourteenth night, accomplished in brilliant beauty. as saith the poet, ""vied the full moon for folly with her face,  but was eclipsed and split for rage full sore; and if the spiring bn with her contend  perish her hands who load of fuel bore!"" and how well saith another, ""say to the fair in the wroughten veil  how hast made that monk-like worshipper ail? light of veil and light of face under it  made the hosts of darkness to fly from bale; and, when came my glance to steal look at cheek.  with a meteor-shaft the guard made me quail."" then said the broker to the merchants, ""how much do ye bid for the union-pearl of the diver and prize-quarry of the fowler?"" quoth one, ""she is mine for an hundred dinars."" and another said, ""two hundred,"" and a third, ""three hundred""; and they ceased not to bid, one against other, till they made her price nine hundred and fifty dinars, and there the biddings stopped awaiting acceptance and consent.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-first night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the merchants bid one against other till they made the price of the girl nine hundred and fifty dinars. then the broker went up to her persian master and said to him, ""the biddings for this thy slavegirl have reached nine hundred and fifty dinars: so say me, wilt thou sell her at that price and take the money?"" asked the persian, ""doth she consent to this? i desire to fall in with her wishes, for i sickened on my journey hither and this handmaid tended me with all possible tenderness, wherefore i sware not to sell her but to him whom she should like and approve, and i have put her sale in her own hand. so do thou consult her and if she say, 'i consent,' sell her to whom thou wilt: but an she say, 'no,' sell her not."" so the broker went up to her and asked her, ""o princess of fair ones, know that thy master putteth thy sale in thine own hands, and thy price hath reached nine hundred and fifty dinars; dost thou give me leave to sell thee?"" she answered, ""show me him who is minded to buy me before clinching the bargain."" so he brought her up to one of the merchants a man stricken with years and decrepit; and she looked at him a long while, then turned to the broker and said to him, ""o broker, art thou jinn-mad or afflicted in thy wit?"" replied he, ""why dost thou ask me this, o princess of fair ones?""; and said she, ""is it permitted thee of allah to sell the like of me to yonder decrepit old man, who saith of his wife's case these couplets, 'quoth she to me,and sore enraged for wounded pride was she,  for she in sooth had bidden me to that which might not be, 'an if thou swive me not forthright, as one should swive his wife,  thou be made a cuckold straight, reproach it not to me. meseems thy yard is made of wax, for very flaccidness;  for when i rub it with my hand, it softens instantly.' and said he likewise of his yard, 'i have a yard that sleeps in base and shameful way  when grants my lover boon for which i sue and pray: but when i wake o' mornings all alone in bed,  'tis fain o' foin and fence and fierce for futter-play.' and again quoth he thereof of his yard, 'i have a froward yard of temper ill  dishonoring him who shows it most regard: it stands when sleep i, when i stand it sleeps  heaven pity not who pitieth that yard!'"" when the old merchant heard this ill flouting from the damsel, he was wroth with wrath exceeding beyond which was no proceeding and said to the broker, ""o most ill-omened of brokers, thou hast not brought into the market this ill-conditioned wench but to gibe me and make mock of me before the merchants."" then the broker took her aside and said to her, ""o my lady, be not wanting in self-respect. the shaykh at whom thou didst mock is the syndic of the bazar and inspector thereof and a committee-man of the council of the merchants."" but she laughed and improvised these two couplets, ""it behoveth folk who rule in our time,  and 'tis one of the duties of magistrateship, to hand up the wali above his door  and beat with a whip the mohtasib!"" adding, ""by allah, o my lord, i will not be sold to yonder old man; so sell me to other than him, for haply he will be abashed at me and vend me again and i shall become a mere servant and it beseemeth not that i sully myself with menial service; and indeed thou knowest that the matter of my sale is committed to myself."" he replied, ""i hear and i obey,"" and carried her to a man which was one of the chief merchants. and when standing hard by him the broker asked, ""how sayst thou, o my lady? shall i sell thee to my lord sharf al-dn here for nine hundred and fifty gold pieces?"" she looked at him and, seeing him to be an old man with a dyed beard, said to the broker, ""art thou silly, that thou wouldst sell me to this worn out father antic? am i cotton refuse or threadbare rags that thou marchest me about from greybeard to greybeard, each like a wall ready to fall or an ifrit smitten down of a fire-ball? as for the first, the poet had him in mind when he said, 'i sought of a fair maid to kiss her lips of coral red, but, 'no, by him who fashioned things from nothingness!' she said. unto the white of hoary hairs i never had a mind, and shall my mouth be stuffed, forsooth, with cotton, ere i'm dead?' and how goodly is the saying of the poet, 'the wise have said that white of hair is light that shines and robes  the face of man with majesty and light that awes the sight; yet until hoary seal shall stamp my parting-place of hair  i hope and pray that same may be black as the blackest night. albe time-whitened beard of man be like the book he bears  when to his lord he must return, i'd rather 'twere not white,' and yet goodlier is the saying of another, 'a guest hath stolen on my head and honour may he lack!  the sword a milder deed hath done that dared these locks to hack. avaunt, o whiteness, wherein naught of brightness gladdens sight  thou 'rt blacker in the eyes of me than very blackest black!' as for the other, he is a model of wantonness and scurrilousness and a blackener of the face of hoariness; his dye acteth the foulest of lies: and the tongue of his case reciteth these lines, 'quoth she to me, 'i see thou dy'st thy hoariness;' and i, 'i do but hide it from thy sight, o thou mine ear and eye!' she laughed out mockingly and said, 'a wonder 'tis indeed! thou so aboundest in deceit that even thy hair's a lie.' and how excellent is the saying of the poet, 'o thou who dyest hoariness with black,  that youth wi' thee abide, at least in show; look ye, my lot was dyd black whilome  and (take my word!) none other hue 'twill grow.'"" when the old man with dyed beard heard such words from the slave-girl, he raged with exceeding rage in fury's last stage and said to the broker, ""o most ill-omened of brokers, this day thou hast brought to our market naught save this gibing baggage to flout at all who are therein, one after other, and fleer at them with flyting verse and idle jest?"" and he came down from his shop and smote on the face the broker, who took her an angered and carried her away, saying to her, ""by allah, never in my life saw i a more shameless wench than thyself! thou hast cut off my daily bread and thine own this day and all the merchants will bear me a grudge on thine account."" then they saw on the way a merchant called shihab al-din who bid ten dinars more for her, and the broker asked her leave to sell her to him. quoth she, ""trot him out that i may see him and question him of a certain thing, which if he have in his house, i will be sold to him; and if not, then not."" so the broker left her standing there and going up to shihab al-din, said to him, ""o my lord, know that yonder damsel tells me she hath a mind to ask thee somewhat, which an thou have, she will be sold to thee. now thou hast heard what she said to thy fellows, the merchants,""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-second night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the broker said to the merchant, ""thou hast heard what this handmaid said to thy fellows, the traders, and by allah, i fear to bring her to thee, lest she do with thee like as she did with thy neighbours and so i fall into disgrace with thee: but, an thou bid me bring her to thee, i will bring her."" quoth the merchant, ""hither with her to me."" ""hearing and obeying,"" answered the broker and fetched for the purchaser the damsel, who looked at him and said, ""o my lord, shihab al-din, hast thou in thy house round cushions stuffed with ermine strips?"" replied shihab al-din, ""yes, o princess of fair ones, i have at home half a score such cushions; but i conjure thee by allah, tell me, what will thou do with them?"" quoth she, ""i will bear with thee till thou be asleep, when i will lay them on thy mouth and nose and press them down till thou die."" then she turned to the broker and said to him, ""o thou refuse of brokers, meseemeth thou art mad, in that thou showest me this hour past, first to a pair of greybeards, in each of whom are two faults, and then thou proferrest me to my lord shihab al-din wherein be three defects; and thirdly, he is dwarfish, secondly, he hath a nose which is big, and thirdly, he hath a beard which is long. of him quoth one of the poets, 'we never heard of wight nor yet espied  who amid men three gifts hath unified: to wit, a beard one cubit long, a snout  span-long and figure tall a finger wide:' and quoth another poet, 'from the plain of his face springs a minaret  like a bezel of ring on his finger set: did creation enter that vasty nose  no created thing would elsewhere be met.'"" when shihab al-din heard this, he came down from his shop and seized the broker by the collar, saying, ""o scurviest of brokers, what aileth thee to bring us a damsel to flout and make mock of us, one after other, with her verses and talk that a curse is?"" so the broker took her and carried her away from before him and fared, saying, ""by allah, all my life long, since i have plied this profession never set i eyes on the like of thee for unmannerliness nor aught more curst to me than thy star, for thou hast cut off my livelihood this day and i have gained no profit by thee save cuffs on the neck-nape and catching by the collar!"" then he brought her to the shop of another merchant, owner of negro slaves and white servants, and stationing her before him, said to her, ""wilt thou be sold to this my lord 'al al-dn?"" she looked at him and seeing him hump-backed, said, ""this is a gobbo, and quoth the poet of him, 'drawn in thy shoulders are and spine thrust out,  as seeking star which satan gave the lout; or as he tasted had first smack of scourge  and looked in marvel for a second bout.' and saith another on the same theme, 'as one of you who mounted mule,  a sight for me to ridicule: is 't not a farce? who feels surprise  an start and bolt with him the mule?' and another on a similar subject, 'oft hunchback addeth to his bunchy back  faults which gar folk upon his front look black: like branch distort and dried by length of days  with citrons hanging from it loose and slack.'"" with this the broker hurried up to her and, carrying her to another merchant, said to her, ""wilt thou be sold to this one?"" she looked at him and said, ""in very sooth this man is blue-eyed; how wilt thou sell me to him?"" quoth one of the poets, 'his eyelids sore and bleared  weakness of frame denote: arise, ye folk and see  within his eyes the mote!'"" then the broker carried her to another and she looked at him and seeing that he had a long beard, said to the broker, ""fie upon thee! this is a ram, whose tail hath sprouted from his gullet. wilt thou sell me to him, o unluckiest of brokers? hast thou not heard say: 'all long of beard are little of wits? indeed, after the measure of the length of the beard is the lack of sense; and this is a well-known thing among men of understanding.' as saith one of the poets, 'ne'er was a man with beard grown overlong,  tho' be he therefor reverenced and fear'd, but who the shortness noted in his wits  added to longness noted in his beard.' and quoth another, 'i have a friend with a beard which god hath made to grow to a useless length, it is like unto one of the nights of winter long and dark and cold.'"" with this the broker took her and turned away with her, and she asked, ""whither goest thou with me?"" he answered, ""back to thy master the persian; it sufficeth me what hath befallen me because of thee this day; for thou hast been the means of spoiling both my trade and his by thine ill manners."" then she looked about the market right and left, front and rear till, by the decree of the decreer her eyes fell on ali nur al-din the cairene. so she gazed at him and saw him to be a comely youth of straight slim form and smooth of face, fourteen years old, rare in beauty and loveliness and elegance and amorous grace like the full moon on the fourteenth night with forehead flower-white, and cheeks rosy red, neck like alabaster and teeth than jewels and dews of lips sweeter than sugar, even as saith of him one of his describers, ""came to match him in beauty and loveliness rare  full moons and gazelles but quoth i, 'soft fare! fare softly, gazelles, nor yourselves compare  with him and, o moons, all your pains forbear!'"" and how well saith another bard, ""slim-waisted loveling, from his hair and brow  men wake a-morn in night and light renewed. blame not the mole that dwelleth on his cheek  for nu'uman's bloom aye shows spot negro-hued."" when the slave-girl beheld nur al-din he interposed between her and her wits; she fell in love to him with a great and sudden fall and her heart was taken with affection for him;and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-third night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the slave-girl beheld nur al-din, her heart was taken with affection for him; so she turned to the broker and said to him, ""will not yonder young merchant, who is sitting among the traders in the gown of striped broadcloth, bid somewhat more for me?"" the broker replied, ""o lady of fair ones, yonder young man is a stranger from cairo, where his father is chief of the trader-guild and surpasseth all the merchants and notables of the place. he is but lately come to this our city and lodgeth with one of his father's friends; but he hath made no bid for thee nor more nor less."" when the girl heard the broker's words, she drew from her finger a costly signet-ring of ruby and said to the man, ""carry me to yonder youth, and if he buy me, this ring shall be thine, in requital of thy travail with me this day."" the broker rejoiced at this and brought her up to nur al-din, and she considered him straitly and found him like the full moon, perfect in loveliness and a model of fine stature and symmetric grace, even as saith of him one of his describers. ""waters of beauty o'er his cheeks flow bright,  and rain his glances shafts that sorely smite: choked are his lovers an he deal disdain's  bitterest draught denaying love-delight. his forehead and his stature and my love  are perfect perfected perfection-dight; his raiment folds enfold a lovely neck  as crescent moon in collar buttoned tight: his eyne and twinnd moles and tears of me  are night that nighteth to the nightliest night. his eyebrows and his features and my frame  crescents on crescents are as crescents slight: his pupils pass the wine-cup to his friends  which, albe sweet, tastes bitter to my sprite; and to my thirsty throat pure drink he dealt  from smiling lips what day we were unite: then is my blood to him, my death to him  his right and rightful and most righteous right."" the girl gazed at nur al-din and said, ""o my lord, allah upon thee, am i not beautiful?""; and he replied, ""o princess of fair ones, is there in the world a comelier than thou?"" she rejoined, ""then why seest thou all the other merchants bid high for me and art silent nor sayest a word neither addest one dinar to my price? 'twould seem i please thee not, o my lord!"" quoth he, ""o my lady, were i in my own land, i had bought thee with all that my hand possesseth of monies;"" and quoth she, ""o my lord, i said not, 'buy me against thy will,' yet, didst thou but add somewhat to my price, it would hearten my heart, though thou buy me not, so the merchants may say, 'were not this girl handsome, yonder merchant of cairo had not bidden for her, for the cairenes are connoisseurs in slave-girls.'"" these words abashed nur al-din and he blushed and said to the broker, ""how high are the biddings for her?"" he replied, ""her price hath reached nine hundred and sixty dinars, besides brokerage, as for the sultan's dues, they fall on the seller."" quoth nur al-din, ""let me have her for a thousand dinars, brokerage and price."" and the damsel hastening to the fore and leaving the broker, said ""i sell myself to this handsome young man for a thousand dinars."" but nur al-din held his peace. quoth one, ""we sell to him;"" and another, ""he deserveth her;"" and a third, ""accursed, son of accursed, is he who biddeth and doth not buy!""; and a fourth, ""by allah, they befit each other!"" then, before nur al-din could think, the broker fetched kazis and witnesses, who wrote out a contract of sale and purchase; and the broker handed the paper to nur al-din, saying, ""take thy slave-girl and allah bless thee in her for she beseemeth none but thee and none but thou beseemeth her."" and he recited these two couplets, ""boom fortune sought him in humblest way  and came to him draggle-tailed, all a-stir: and none is fittest for him but she  and none is fittest but he for her."" hereat nur al-din was abashed before the merchants; so he arose without stay or delay and weighed out the thousand dinars which he had left as a deposit with his father's friend the druggist, and taking the girl, carried her to the house wherein the shaykh had lodged him. when she entered and saw nothing but ragged patched carpets and worn out rugs, she said to him, ""o my lord, have i no value to thee and am i not worthy that thou shouldst bear me to thine own house and home wherein are thy goods, that thou bringest me into thy servant's lodging? why dost thou not carry me to thy father's dwelling?"" he replied, ""by allah, o princess of fair ones, this is my house wherein i dwell; but it belongeth to an old man, a druggist of this city, who hath set it apart for me and lodged me therein. i told thee that i was a stranger and that i am of the sons of cairo city."" she rejoined, ""o my lord, the least of houses sufficeth till thy return to thy native place; but, allah upon thee, o my lord, go now and fetch us somewhat of roast meat and wine and dried fruit and dessert."" quoth nur al-din, ""by allah, o princess of fair ones, i had no money with me but the thousand dinars i paid down to thy price nor possess i any other good. the few dirhams i owned were spent by me yesterday."" quoth she, ""hast thou no friend in the town, of whom thou mayst borrow fifty dirhams and bring them to me, that i may tell thee what thou shalt do therewith?"" and he said, ""i have no intimate but the druggist."" then he betook himself forthright to the druggist and said to him, ""peace be with thee, o uncle!"" he returned his salam and said to him, ""o my son, what hast thou bought for a thousand dinars this day?"" nur al-din replied, ""i have bought a slave-girl;"" and the oldster rejoined, ""o my son, art thou mad that thou givest a thousand dinars for one slave-girl? would i knew what kind of slave-girl she is?"" said nur al-din, ""she is a damsel of the children of the franks;""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-fourth night, she resumed, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nur al-din said to the ancient druggist, ""the damsel is of the children of the franks;"" and the shaykh said, ""o my son, the best of the girls of the franks are to be had in this our town for an hundred dinars, and by allah, o my son, they have cheated thee in the matter of this damsel! however, an thou have taken a fancy to her, lie with her this night and do thy will of her and to-morrow morning go down with her to the market and sell her, though thou lose by her two hundred dinars, and reckon that thou hast lost them by shipwreck or hast been robbed of them on the road."" nur al-din replied, ""right is thy rede, o uncle, but thou knowest that i had but the thousand dinars wherewith i purchased the damsel, and now i have not a single dirham left to spend; so i desire of thy favour and bounty that thou lend me fifty dirhams, to provide me withal, till to-morrow, when i will sell her and repay thee out of her price."" said the old man, ""willingly, o my son,"" and counted out to him the fifty dirhams. then he said to him, ""o my son, thou art but young in years and the damsel is fair, so belike thy heart will be taken with her and it will be grievous to thee to vend her. now thou hast nothing to live on and these fifty dirhams will readily be spent and thou wilt come to me and i shall lend thee once and twice and thrice, and so on up to ten times; but, an thou come to me after this, i will not return thy salam and our friendship with thy father will end ill."" nur al-din took the fifty dirhams and returned with them to the damsel, who said to him, ""o my lord, wend thee at once to the market and fetch me twenty dirhams' worth of stained silk of five colours and with the other thirty buy meat and bread and fruit and wine and flowers."" so he went to the market and purchasing for her all she sought, brought it to her, whereupon she rose and tucking up her sleeves, cooked food after the most skilful fashion, and set it before him. he ate and she ate with him, till they had enough, after which she set on the wine, and she drank and he drank, and she ceased not to ply him with drink and entertain him with discourse, till he became drunken and fell asleep. thereupon she arose without stay or delay and taking out of her bundle a budget of tif leather, opened it and drew forth a pair of knitting needles, wherewith she fell to work and stinted not till she had made a beautiful zone, which she folded up in a wrapper after cleaning it and ironing it, and laid it under her pillow. then she doffed her dress till she was mother-naked and lying down beside nur al-din shampoo'd him till he awoke from his heavy sleep. he found by his side a maiden like virgin silver, softer than silk and delicater than a tail of fatted sheep, than standard more conspicuous and goodlier than the red camel, in height five feet tall with breasts firm and full, brows like bended bows, eyes like gazelles' eyes and cheeks like blood-red anemones, a slender waist with dimples laced and a navel holding an ounce of the unguent benzoin, thighs like bolsters stuffed with ostrich-down, and between them what the tongue fails to set forth and at mention whereof the tears jet forth. brief it was as it were she to whom the poet alluded in these two couplets, ""from her hair is night, from her forehead noon  from her side-face rose; from her lip wine boon: from her union heaven, her severance hell:  pearls from her teeth; from her front full moon."" and how excellent is the saying of another bard, ""a moon she rises, willow-wand she waves  breathes ambergris and gazeth a gazelle. meseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins  and when she wends makes haste therein to dwell. her face is fairer than the stars of wealth  and sheeny brows the crescent moon excel."" and quoth a third also, ""they shine fullest moons, unveil crescent-bright;  sway tenderest branches and turn wild kine; 'mid which is a dark-eyed for love of whose charms  the sailors would joy to be ground low-li'en."" so nur al-din turned to her at once and clasping her to his bosom, sucked first her upper lip and then her under lip and slid his tongue between the twain into her mouth. then he rose to her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly none but he had ridden. so he abated her maidenhead and had of her amorous delight and there was knitted between them a love-bond which might never know breach nor severance. he rained upon her cheeks kisses like the falling of pebbles into water, and struck with stroke upon stroke, like the thrusting of spears in battle brunt; for that nur al-din still yearned after clipping of necks and sucking of lips and letting down of tress and pressing of waist and biting of cheek and cavalcading on breast with cairene buckings and yamani wrigglings and abyssinian sobbings and hind pamoisons and nubian lasciviousness and rf leg-liftings and damiettan moanings and sa'd hotness and alexandrian languishment and this damsel united in herself all these virtues, together with excess of beauty and loveliness, and indeed she was even as saith of her the poet, ""this is she i will never forget till i die  nor draw near but to those who to her draw nigh. a being for semblance like moon at full  praise her maker, her modeller glorify! tho' be sore my sin seeking love-liesse  on esperance-day ne'er repent can i; a couplet reciting which none can know  save the youth who in couplets and rhymes shall cry, 'none weeteth love but who bears its load  nor passion, save pleasures and pains he aby.'"" so nur al-din lay with the damsel through the night in solace and delight,and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-fifth night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nur al-din lay with that damsel through the night in solace and delight, the twain garbed in the closely buttoned garments of embrace, safe and secure against the misways of nights and days, and they passed the dark hours after the goodliest fashion, fearing naught, in their joys love-fraught, from excess of talk and prate. as saith of them the right excellent poet, ""go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not the words detractors utter; envious churls can never favour love. oh! sure the merciful ne'er make a thing more fair to look upon, than two fond lovers in each other's arms, speaking their passion in a mute embrace. when heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them strike idly on cold steel. so when thou'st found one purely, wholly thine, accept her true heart, and live for her alone. oh! thou that blamest the love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk how canst thou minister to a mind diseased?"" when the morning morrowed in sheen and shone, nur al-din awoke from deep sleep and found that she had brought water: so they made the ghusl-ablution, he and she, and he performed that which behoved him of prayer to his lord, after which she set before him meat and drink, and he ate and drank. then the damsel put her hand under her pillow and pulling out the girdle which she had knitted during the night, gave it to nur al-din, who asked, ""whence cometh this girdle?"" answered she, ""o my lord, 'tis the silk thou boughtest yesterday for twenty dirhams. rise now and go to the persian bazar and give it to the broker, to cry for sale, and sell it not for less than twenty gold pieces in ready money."" quoth nur al-din, ""o princess of fair ones how can a thing, that cost twenty dirhams and will sell for as many dinars, be made in a single night?""; and quoth she, ""o my lord, thou knowest not the value of this thing; but go to the market therewith and give it to the broker, and when he shall cry it, its worth will be made manifest to thee."" herewith he carried the zone to the market and gave it to the broker, bidding him cry it, whilst he himself sat down on a masonry bench before a shop. the broker fared forth and returning after a while said to him, ""o my lord, rise take the price of thy zone, for it hath fetched twenty dinars money down."" when nur al-din heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and shook with delight. then he rose, between belief and misbelief, to take the money and when he had received it, he went forthright and spent it all on silk of various colours and returning home, gave his purchase to the damsel, saying, ""make this all into girdles and teach me likewise how to make them, that i may work with thee; for never in the length of my life saw i a fairer craft than this craft nor a more abounding in gain and profit. by allah, 'tis better than the trade of a merchant a thousand times!"" she laughed at his language and said, ""o my lord, go to thy friend the druggist and borrow other thirty dirhams of him, and to-morrow repay him from the price of the girdle the thirty together with the fifty already loaned to thee."" so he rose and repaired to the druggist and said to him, ""o uncle, lend me other thirty dirhams, and to-morrow, almighty allah willing, i will repay thee the whole fourscore."" the old man weighed him out thirty dirhams, wherewith he went to the market and buying meat and bread, dried fruits, and flowers as before, carried them home to the damsel whose name was miriam, the girdle-girl. she rose forthright and making ready rich meats, set them before her lord nur al-din; after which she brought the wine-service and they drank and plied each other with drink. when the wine began to play with their wits, his pleasant address and inner grace pleased her, and she recited these two couplets, ""said i to slim-waist who the wine engraced  brought in musk-scented bowl and a superfine, 'was it prest from thy cheek?' he replied 'nay, nay!  when did man from roses e'er press the wine?'"" and the damsel ceased not to carouse with her lord and ply him with cup and bowl and require him to fill for her and give her to drink of that which sweeteneth the spirits, and whenever he put forth hand to her, she drew back from him, out of coquetry. the wine added to her beauty and loveliness, and nur al-din recited these two couplets, ""slim-waist craved wine from her companeer;  cried (in meeting of friends when he feared for his fere,) 'an thou pass not the wine thou shalt pass the night,  a-banisht my bed!' and he felt sore fear."" they ceased not drinking till drunkenness overpowered nur al-din and he slept; whereupon she rose forthright and fell to work upon a zone, as was her wont. when she had wrought it to end, she wrapped it in paper and doffing her clothes, lay down by his side and enjoyed dalliance and delight till morn appeared.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-sixth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that miriam the girdle-girl, having finished her zone and wrapped it in paper doffed her dress and lay down by the side of her lord; and then happened to them what happened of dalliance and delight; and he did his devoir like a man. on the morrow, she gave him the girdle and said to him, ""carry this to the market and sell it for twenty dinars, even as thou soldest its fellow yesterday."" so he went to the bazar and sold the girdle for twenty dinars, after which he repaired to the druggist and paid him back the eighty dirhams, thanking him for the bounties and calling down blessings upon him. he asked, ""o my son, hast thou sold the damsel?""; and nur al-din answered, ""wouldst thou have me sell the soul out of my body?"" and he told him all that had passed, from commencement to conclusion, whereat the druggist joyed with joy galore, than which could be no more and said to him, ""by allah, o my son, thou gladdenest me! inshallah, mayst thou ever be in prosperity! indeed i wish thee well by reason of my affection for thy ather and the continuance of my friendship with him."" then nur al-din left the shaykh and straightway going to the market, bought meat and fruit and wine and all that he needed according to his custom and returned therewith to miriam. they abode thus a whole year in eating and drinking and mirth and merriment and love and good comradeship, and every night she made a zone and he sold it on the morrow for twenty dinars, wherewith he bought their needs and gave the rest to her, to keep against a time of necessity. after the twelvemonth she said to him one day, ""o my lord, whenas thou sellest the girdle to-morrow, buy for me with its price silk of six colours, because i am minded to make thee a kerchief to wear on thy shoulders, such as never son of merchant, no, nor king's son, ever rejoiced in its like."" so next day he fared forth to the bazar and after selling the zone brought her the dyed silks she sought and miriam the girdle-girl wrought at the kerchief a whole week, for, every night, when she had made an end of the zone, she would work awhile at the kerchief till it was finished. then she gave it to nur al-din, who put it on his shoulders and went out to walk in the market-place, whilst all the merchants and folk and notables of the town crowded about him, to gaze on his beauty and that of the kerchief which was of the most beautiful. now it chanced that one night, after this, he awoke from sleep and found miriam weeping passing sore and reciting these couplets, ""nears my parting fro' my love, nigher draws the severance-day  ah well-away for parting! and again ah well-away! and in tway is torn my heart and o pine i'm doomed to bear  for the nights that erst witnessed our pleasurable play! no help for it but envier the twain of us espy  with evil eye and win to us his lamentable way. for naught to us is sorer than the jealousy of men  and the backbiter's eyne that with calumny affray."" he said, ""o my lady miriam, what aileth thee to weep?""; and she replied, ""i weep for the anguish of parting for my heart presageth me thereof."" quoth he, ""o lady of fair ones, and who shall interpose between us, seeing that i love thee above all creatures and tender thee the most?""; and quoth she, ""and i love thee twice as well as thou me; but fair opinion of fortune still garreth folk fall into affliction, and right well saith the poet, 'think'st thou thyself all prosperous, in days which prosp'rous be, nor fearest thou impending ill, which comes by heaven's decree? we see the orbs of heav'n above, how numberless they are, but sun and moon alone eclips'd, and ne'er a lesser star! and many a tree on earth we see, some bare, some leafy green, of them, not one is hurt with stone save that has fruitful been! see'st not th' refluent ocean, bear carrion on its tide, while pearls beneath its wavy flow, fixed in the deep, abide?'"" presently she added, ""o my lord nur al-din, an thou desire to nonsuit separation, be on thy guard against a swart-visaged oldster, blind of the right eye and lame of the left leg; for he it is who will be the cause of our severance. i saw him enter the city and i opine that he is come hither in quest of me."" replied nur al-din, ""o lady of fair ones, if my eyes light on him, i will slay him and make an example of him."" rejoined she, ""o my lord, slay him not; but talk not nor trade with him, neither buy nor sell with him nor sit nor walk with him nor speak one word to him, no, not even the answer prescribed by law, and i pray allah to preserve us from his craft and his mischief."" next morning, nur al-din took the zone and carried it to the market, where he sat down on a shop-bench and talked with the sons of the merchants, till the drowsiness preceding slumber overcame him and he lay down on the bench and fell asleep. presently, behold, up came the frank whom the damsel had described to him, in company with seven others, and seeing nur al-din lying asleep on the bench, with his head wrapped in the kerchief which miriam had made for him and the edge thereof in his grasp, sat down by him and hent the end of the kerchief in hand and examined it, turning it over for some time. nur al-din sensed that there was something and awoke; then, seeing the very man of whom miriam had warned him sitting by his side, cried out at him with a great cry which startled him. quoth the frank, ""what aileth thee to cry out thus at us? have we taken from thee aught?""; and quoth nur al-din, ""by allah, o accursed, haddest thou taken aught from me, i would carry thee before the chief of police!"" then said the frank, ""o moslem, i conjure thee by thy faith and by that wherein thou believest, inform me whence thou haddest this kerchief;"" and nur al-din replied, ""tis the handiwork of my lady mother,""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-seventh night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the frank asked nur al-din anent the maker of the kerchief, he answered, saying, ""in very sooth this kerchief is the handiwork of my mother, who made it for me with her own hand."" quoth the frank ""wilt thou sell it to me and take ready money for it?,"" and quoth nur al-din, ""by allah, i will not sell it to thee or to any else, for she made none other than it."" ""sell it to me and i will give thee to its price this very moment five hundred dinars, money down; and let her who made it make thee another and a finer."" ""i will not sell it at all, for there is not the like of it in this city."" ""o my lord, wilt thou sell it for six hundred ducats of fine gold?"" and the frank went on to add to his offer hundred by hundred, till he bid nine hundred dinars; but nur al-din said, ""allah will open to me otherwise than by my vending it. i will never sell it, not for two thousand dinars nor more than that; no, never."" the frank ceased not to tempt him with money, till he bid him a thousand dinars, and the merchants present said, ""we sell thee the kerchief at that price: pay down the money."" quoth nur al-din, ""i will not sell it, i swear by allah!"" but one of the merchants said to him, ""know thou, o my son, that the value of this kerchief is an hundred dinars at most and that to an eager purchaser, and if this frank pay thee down a thousand for it, thy profit will be nine hundred dinars, and what gain canst thou desire greater than this gain? wherefore 'tis my rede that thou sell him this kerchief at that price and bid her who wrought it make thee other finer than it: so shalt thou profit nine hundred dinars by this accursed frank, the enemy of allah and of the faith."" nur al-din was abashed at the merchants and sold the kerchief to the frank, who, in their presence, paid him down the thousand dinars, with which he would have returned to his handmaid to congratulate her on what had passed; but the stranger said, ""harkye, o company of merchants, stop my lord nur al-din, for you and he are my guests this night. i have a jar of old greek wine and a fat lamb, fresh fruit, flowers and confections; wherefore do ye all cheer me with your company to-night and not one of you tarry behind."" so the merchants said, ""o my lord nur al-din, we desire that thou be with us on the like of this night, so we may talk together, we and thou, and we pray thee, of thy favour and bounty, to bear us company, so we and thou, may be the guests of this frank, for he is a liberal man."" and they conjured him by the oath of divorce and hindered him by main force from going home. then they rose forthright and shutting up their shops, took nur al-din and fared with the frank, who brought them to a goodly and spacious saloon, wherein were two dases. here he made them sit and set before them a scarlet tray-cloth of goodly workmanship and unique handiwork, wroughten in gold with figures of breaker and broken, lover and beloved, asker and asked, whereon he ranged precious vessels of porcelain and crystal, full of the costliest confections, fruits and flowers, and brought them a flagon of old greek wine. then he bade slaughter a fat lamb and kindling fire, proceeded to roast of its flesh and feed the merchants therewith and give them draughts of that wine, winking at them the while to ply nur al-din with drink. accordingly they ceased not plying him with wine till he became drunken and took leave of his wits; so when the frank saw that he was drowned in liquor, he said to him, ""o my lord nur al-din, thou gladdenest us with thy company to-night: welcome, and again welcome to thee."" then he engaged him awhile in talk, till he could draw near to him, when he said, with dissembling speech, ""o my lord, nur al-din, wilt thou sell me thy slave-girl, whom thou boughtest in presence of these merchants a year ago for a thousand dinars? i will give thee at this moment five thousand gold pieces for her and thou wilt thus make four thousand ducats profit."" nur al-din refused, but the frank ceased not to ply him with meat and drink and lure him with lucre, still adding to his offers, till he bid him ten thousand dinars for her; whereupon nur al-din, in his drunkenness, said before the merchants, ""i sell her to thee for ten thousand dinars: hand over the money."" at this the frank rejoiced with joy exceeding and took the merchants to witness the sale. they passed the night in eating and drinking, mirth and merriment, till the morning, when the frank cried out to his pages, saying, ""bring me the money."" so they brought it to him and he counted out ten thousand dinars to nur al-din, saying, ""o my lord, take the price of thy slave-girl, whom thou soldest to me last night, in the presence of these moslem merchants."" replied nur al-din, ""o accursed, i sold thee nothing and thou liest anent me, for i have no slave-girls."" quoth the frank, ""in very sooth thou didst sell her to me and these merchants were witnesses to the bargain."" thereupon all said, ""yes, indeed! thou soldest him thy slave-girl before us for ten thousand dinars, o nur al-din and we will all bear witness against thee of the sale. come, take the money and deliver him the girl, and allah will give thee a better than she in her stead. doth it irk thee, o nur al-din, that thou boughtest the girl for a thousand dinars and hast enjoyed for a year and a half her beauty and loveliness and taken thy fill of her converse and her favours? furthermore thou hast gained some ten thousand golden dinars by the sale of the zones which she made thee every day and thou soldest for twenty sequins, and after all this thou hast sold her again at a profit of nine thousand dinars over and above her original price. and withal thou deniest the sale and belittlest and makest difficulties about the profit! what gain is greater than this gain and what profit wouldst thou have profitabler than this profit? an thou love her thou hast had thy fill of her all this time: so take the money and buy thee another handsomer than she; at a dowry of less than half this price, and the rest of the money will remain in thy hand as capital."" and the merchants ceased not to ply him with persuasion and special arguments till he took the ten thousand dinars, the price of the damsel, and the frank straightway fetched kazis and witnesses, who drew up the contract of sale by nur al-din of the handmaid hight miriam the girdle-girl. such was his case; but as regards the damsel's, she sat awaiting her lord from morning till sundown and from sundown till the noon of night; and when he returned not, she was troubled and wept with sore weeping. the old druggist heard her sobbing and sent his wife, who went in to her and finding her in tears, said to her, ""o my lady, what aileth her and finding her in tears, said to her, ""o my lady, what aileth thee to weep?"" said she, ""o my mother, i have sat waiting the return of my lord, nur al-din all day; but he cometh not, and i fear lest some one have played a trick on him, to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me.""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-eighth night, she resumed, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that miriam the girdle-girl said to the druggist's wife, ""i am fearful lest some one have been playing a trick on my lord to make him sell me, and he have fallen into the snare and sold me."" said the other, ""o my lady miriam, were they to give thy lord this hall full of gold as thy price, yet would he not sell thee, for what i know of his love to thee. but, o my lady, belike there be a company come from his parents at cairo and he hath made them an entertainment in the lodging where they alighted, being ashamed to bring them hither, for that the place is not spacious enough for them or because their condition is less than that he should bring them to his own house; or belike he preferred to conceal thine affair from them, so passed the night with them; and inshallah! to-morrow he will come to thee safe and sound. so burden not thy soul with cark and care, o my lady, for of a certainty this is the cause of his absence from thee last night and i will abide with thee this coming night and comfort thee, until thy lord return to thee."" so the druggist's wife abode with her and cheered her with talk throughout the dark hours and, when it was morning, miriam saw her lord enter the street followed by the frank and amiddlemost a company of merchants, at which sight her side-muscles quivered and her colour changed and she fell a-shaking, as ship shaketh in mid-ocean for the violence of the gale. when the druggist's wife saw this, she said to her, ""o my lady miriam what aileth thee that i see thy case changed and thy face grown pale and show disfeatured?"" replied she, ""by allah, o my lady, my heart forebodeth me of parting and severance of union!"" and she bemoaned herself with the saddest sighs, reciting these couplets, ""incline not to parting, i pray;  for bitter its savour is aye. e'en the sun at his setting turns pale  to think he must part from the day; and so, at his rising, for joy  of reunion, he's radiant and gay."" then miriam wept passing sore wherethan naught could be more, making sure of separation, and cried to the druggist's wife, ""o my mother, said i not to thee that my lord nur al-din had been tricked into selling me? i doubt not but he hath sold me this night to yonder frank, albeit i bade him beware of him; but deliberation availeth not against destiny. so the truth of my words is made manifest to thee."" whilst they were talking, behold, in came nur al-din, and the damsel looked at him and saw that his colour was changed and that he trembled and there appeared on his face signs of grief and repentance: so she said to him, ""o my lord nur al-din, meseemeth thou hast sold me."" whereupon he wept with sore weeping and groaned and lamented and recited these couplets, ""when e'er the lord 'gainst any man, would fulminate some harsh decree, and he be wise, and skilled to hear, and used to see; he stops his ears, and blinds his heart, and from his brain ill judgment tears, and makes it bald as 'twere a scalp, reft of its hairs; until the time when the whole man be pierced by this divine command; then he restores him intellect to understand."" then nur al-din began to excuse himself to his handmaid, saying, ""by allah, o my lady miriam, verily runneth the reed with whatso allah hath decreed. the folk put a cheat on me to make me sell thee, and i fell into the snare and sold thee. indeed, i have sorely failed of my duty to thee; but haply he who decreed our disunion will vouchsafe us reunion."" quoth she, ""i warned thee against this, for this it was i dreaded."" then she strained him to her bosom and kissed him between the eyes, reciting these couplets, ""now, by your love! your love i'll ne'er forget,  though lost my life for stress of pine and fret: i weep and wail through livelong day and night  as moans the dove on sandhill-tree beset. o fairest friends, your absence spoils my life;  nor find i meeting-place as erst we met."" at this juncture, behold, the frank came in to them and went up to miriam, to kiss her hands; but she dealt him a buffet with her palm on the cheek, saying, ""avaunt, o accursed! thou hast followed after me without surcease, till thou hast cozened my lord into selling me! but o accursed, all shall yet be well, inshallah!"" the frank laughed at her speech and wondered at her deed and excused himself to her, saying, ""o my lady mirian, what is my offence? thy lord nur al-din here sold thee of his full consent and of his own free will. had he loved thee, by the right of the messiah, he had not transgressed against thee! and had he not fulfilled his desire of thee, he had not sold thee."" quoth one of the poets, 'whom i irk let him fly fro' me fast and faster  if i name his name i am no directer. nor the wide wide world is to me so narrow  that i act expecter to this rejecter.'"" now this handmaid was the daughter of the king of france, the which is a wide an spacious city, abounding in manufactures and rarities and trees and flowers and other growths, and resembleth the city of constantinople; and for her going forth of her father's city there was a wondrous cause and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale which we will set out in due order, to divert and delight the hearer.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and seventy-ninth night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the cause of miriam the girdle-girl leaving her father and mother was a wondrous and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale. she was reared with her father and mother in honour and indulgence and learnt rhetoric and penmanship and arithmetic and cavalarice and all manner crafts, such as broidery and sewing and weaving and girdle-making and silk-cord making and damascening gold on silver and silver on gold, brief all the arts both of men and women, till she became the union-pearl of her time and the unique gem of her age and day. moreover, allah (to whom belong might and majesty!) had endowed her with such beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfection of grace that she excelled therein all the folk of her time, and the kings of the isles sought her in marriage of her sire, but he refused to give her to wife to any of her suitors, for that he loved her with passing love and could not bear to be parted from her a single hour. moreover, he had no other daughter than herself, albeit he had many sons, but she was dearer to him than all of them. it fortuned one year that she fell sick of an exceeding sickness and came nigh upon death, werefore she made a vow that, if she recovered from her malady, she would make the pilgrimage to a certain monastery, situate in such an island, which was high in repute among the franks, who used to make vows to it and look for a blessing therefrom. when miriam recovered from her sickness, she wished to accomplish her vow anent the monastery and her sire despatched her to the convent in a little ship, with sundry daughters of the city-notables to wait upon her and patrician knights to protect them all. as they drew near the island, there came out upon them a ship of the ships of the moslems, champions of the faith, warring in allah's way, who boarded the vessel and making prize of all therein, knights and maidens, gifts and monies, sold their booty in the city of kayrawn. miriam herself fell into the hands of a persian merchant, who was born impotent and for whom no woman had ever discovered her nakedness; so he set her to serve him. presently, he fell ill and sickened well nigh unto death, and the sickness abode with him two months, during which she tended him after the goodliest fashion, till allah made him whole of his malady, when he recalled her tenderness and loving-kindness to him and the persistent zeal with which she had nurst him and being minded to requite her the good offices she had done him, said to her, ""ask a boon of me?"" she said, ""o my lord, i ask of thee that thou sell me not but to the man of my choice."" he answered, ""so be it. i guarantee thee. by allah, o miriam, i will not sell thee but to him of whom thou shalt approve, and i put thy sale in thine own hand."" and she rejoiced herein with joy exceeding. now the persian had expounded to her al-islam and she became a moslemah and learnt of him the rules of worship. furthermore during that period the perisan had taught her the tenets of the faith and the observances incumbent upon her: he had made her learn the koran by heart and master somewhat of the theological sciences and the traditions of the prophet; after which, he brought her to alexandria-city and sold her to nur al-din, as we have before set out. meanwhile, when her father, the king of france, heard what had befallen his daughter and her company, he saw doomsday break and sent after her ships full of knights and champions, horsemen and footsmen; but they fell not in any trace of her whom they sought in the islands of the moslems; so all returned to him, crying out and saying, ""well-away!"" and ""ruin!"" and ""well worth the day!"" the king grieved for her with exceeding grief and sent after her that one-eyed lameter, blind of the left, for that he was his chief wazir, a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil, full of craft and guile, bidding him make search for her in all the lands of the moslems and buy her, though with a ship-load of gold. so the accursed sought her, in all the islands of the arabs and all the cities of the moslems, but found no sign of her till he came to alexandria-city where he made quest for her and presently discovered that she was with nur al-din ali the cairene, being directed to the trace of her by the kerchief aforesaid, for that none could have wrought it in such goodly guise but she. then he bribed the merchants to help him in getting her from nur al-din and beguiled her lord into selling her, as hath been already related. when he had her in his possession, she ceased not to weep and wail: so he said to her, ""o my lady miriam, put away from thee this mourning and grieving and return with me to the city of thy sire, the seat of thy kingship and the place of thy power and thy home, so thou mayst be among thy servants and attendants and be quit of this abasement and this strangerhood. enough hath betided me of travail, of travel and of disbursing monies on thine account, for thy father bade me buy thee back, though with a shipload of gold; and now i have spent nigh a year and a half in seeking thee."" and he fell to kissing her hands and feet and humbling himself to her; but the more he kissed and grovelled she only redoubled in wrath against him, and said to him, ""o accursed, may almighty allah not vouchsafe thee to win thy wish!"" presently his pages brought her a shemule with gold-embroidered housings and mounting her thereon, raised over her head a silken canopy, with staves of gold and silver, and the franks walked round about her, till they brought her forth the city by the sea-gate, where they took boat with her and rowing out to a great ship in harbor embarked therein. then the monocular wazir cried out to the sailors, saying, ""up with the mast!"" so they set it up forthright and spreading the newly bent sails and the colours manned the sweeps and put out to sea. meanwhile miriam continued to gaze upon alexandria, till it disappeared from her eyes, when she fell a-weeping in her privacy with sore weeping.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eightieth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the wazir of the frankish king put out to sea in the ship bearing miriam the girdle-girl, she gazed alexandria-wards till the city was hidden from her sight when she wailed and wept copious tears and recited these couplets, ""o dwelling of my friends say is there no return  uswards? but what ken i of matters allah made? still fare the ships of severance, sailing hastily  and in my wounded eyelids tear have ta'en their stead, for parting from a friend who was my wish and will  healed every ill and every pain and pang allay'd. be thou, o allah, substitute of me for him  such charge some day the care of thee shall not evade."" then she could not refrain from weeping and wailing. so the patrician knights came up to her and would have comforted her, but she heeded not their consoling words, being distracted by the claims of passion and love-longing. and she shed tears and moaned and complained and recited these couplets, ""the tongue of love within my vitals speaketh  saying, 'this lover boon of love aye seeketh!' and burn my liver hottest coals of passion  and parting on my heart sore suffering wreaketh. how shall i face this fiery love concealing  when fro' my wounded lids the tear aye leaketh? in this plight miriam abode during all the voyage; no peace was left her at all nor would patience come at her call. such was her case in company with the wazir, the monocular, the lameter; but as regards nur al-din the cairene, when the ship had sailed with miriam, the world was straitened upon him and he had neither peace nor patience. he returned to the lodging where they twain had dwelt, and its aspect was black and gloomy in his sight. then he saw the mtier wherewith she had been wont to make the zones and her dress that had been upon her beauteous body; so he pressed them to his breast, whilst the tears gushed from his eyes and he recited these couplets, ""say me, will union after parting e'er return to be  after long-lasting torments, after hopeless misery? alas! alas! what wont to be shall never more return  but grant me still return of dearest her these eyne may see. i wonder me will allah deign our parted lives unite  and will my dear one's plighted troth preserve with constancy! naught am i save the prey of death since parting parted us;  and will my friends consent that i am a wierd so deadly dree? alas my sorrow! sorrowing the lover scant avails;  indeed i melt away in grief and passion's ecstasy: past is the time of my delight when were we two conjoined:  would heaven i wot if destiny mine esperance will degree! redouble then, o heart, thy pains and, o mine eyes, o'erflow  with tears till not a tear remain within these eyne of me? again alas for loved ones lost and loss of patience eke!  for helpers fail me and my griefs are grown beyond decree. the lord of threefold worlds i pray he deign to me return  my lover and we meet as wont in joy and jubilee."" then nur al-din wept with weeping galore than which naught could be more; and peering into ever corner of the room, recited these two couplets, ""i view their traces and with pain i pine  and by their sometime home i weep and yearn; and him i pray who parting deigned decree  some day he deign vouchsafe me their return!"" then nur al-din sprang to his feet and locking the door of the house, fared forth running at speed, to the sea shore whence he fixed his eyes on the place of the ship which had carried off his miriam whilst sighs burst from his breast and tears from his lids as he recited these couplets, ""peace be with you, sans you naught compensateth me  the near, the far, two cases only here i see: i yearn for you at every hour and tide as yearns  for water-place wayfarer plodding wearily. with you abide my hearing, heart and eyen-sight  and (sweeter than the honeycomb) your memory. then, o my grief when fared afar your retinue  and bore that ship away my sole expectancy."" and nur al-din wept and wailed, bemoaned himself and complained, crying out and saying, ""o miriam! o miriam! was it but a vision of thee i saw in sleep or in the allusions of dreams?"" and by reason of that which grew on him of regrets, he recited these couplets, ""mazed with thy love no more i can feign patience, this heart of mine has held none dear but thee! and if mine eye hath gazed on other's beauty, ne'er be it joyed again with sight of thee! i've sworn an oath i'll ne'er forget to love thee, and sad's this breast that pines to meet with thee! thou'st made me drink a love-cup full of passion, blest time! when i may give the draught to thee! take with thee this my form where'er thou goest, and when thou 'rt dead let me be laid near thee! call on me in my tomb, my bones shall answer and sigh responses to a call from thee! if it were asked, 'what wouldst thou heaven should order?' 'his will,' i answer, 'first, and then what pleases thee.'"" as nur al-din was in this case, weeping and crying out, ""o miriam! o miriam!"" behold, an old man landed from a vessel and coming up to him, saw him shedding tears and heard him reciting these verses, ""o maryam of beauty return, for these eyne  are as densest clouds railing drops in line: ask amid mankind and my railers shall say  that mine eyelids are drowning these eyeballs of mine."" said the old man, ""o my son, meseems thou weepest for the damsel who sailed yesterday with the frank?"" when nur al-din heard these words of the shaykh he fell down in a swoon and lay for a long while without life; then, coming to himself, he wept with sore weeping and improvised these couplets, ""shall we e'er be unite after severance-tide  and return in the perfectest cheer to bide? in my heart indeed is a lowe of love  and i'm pained by the spies who my pain deride: my days i pass in amaze distraught,  and her image a-nights i would see by side: by allah, no hour brings me solace of love  and how can it when makebates vex me and chide? a soft-sided damsel of slenderest waist  her arrows of eyne on my heart hath plied? her form is like bn-tree branch in garth  shame her charms the sun who his face most hide: did i not fear god (be he glorified!)  'my fair be glorified!' had i cried."" the old man looked at him and noting his beauty and grace and symmetry and the fluency of his tongue and the seductiveness of his charms, had ruth on him and his heart mourned for his case. now that shaykh was the captain of a ship, bound to the damsel's city, and in this ship were a hundred moslem merchants, men of the saving faith; so he said to nur al-din, ""have patience and all will yet be well; i will bring thee to her an it be the will of allah, extolled and exalted be he!""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-first night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the old skipper said to nur al-din, ""i will bring thee to her, inshallah!"" the youth asked, ""when shall we set out?"" and the other said, ""come but three days more and we will depart in peace and prosperity."" nur al-din rejoiced at the captain's words with joy exceeding and thanked him for his bounty and benevolence. then he recalled the days of love-liesse dear and union with his slave-girl without peer, and he shed bitter tears and recited these couplets, ""say, will to me and you the ruthful union show  my lords! shall e'er i win the wish of me or no? a visit-boon by you will shifty time vouchsafe?  and seize your image eye-lids which so hungry grow? with you were union to be sold, i fain would buy;  but ah, i see such grace doth all my means outgo!"" then nur al-din went forthright to the market and bought what he needed of viaticum and other necessaries for the voyage and returned to the rais, who said to him, ""o my son, what is that thou hast with thee?"" said he, ""my provisions and all whereof i have need for the voyage."" thereupon quoth the old man, laughing, ""o my son, art thou going a-pleasuring to pompey's pillar? verily, between thee and that thou seekest is two months' journey and the wind be fair and the weather favourable."" then he took of him somewhat of money and going to the bazar, bought him a sufficiency of all that he needed for the voyage and filled him a large earthen jar with fresh water. nur al-din abode in the ship three days until the merchants had made an end of their precautions and preparations and embarked, when they set sail and putting out to sea, fared on one-and-fifty days. after this, there came out upon them corsairs, pirates who sacked the ship and taking nur al-din and all therein prisoners, carried them to the city of france and paraded them before the king, who bade cast them into jail, nur al-din amongst the number. as they were being led to prison the galleon arrived with the princess miriam and the one-eyed wazir, and when it made the harbour, the lameter landed and going up to the king gave him the glad news of his daughter's safe return: whereupon they beat the kettledrums for good tidings and decorated the city after the goodliest fashion. then the king took horse, with all his guards and lords and notables and rode down to the sea to meet her. the moment the ship cast anchor she came ashore, and the king saluted her and embraced her and mounting her on a bloodsteed, bore her to the palace, where her mother received her with open arms, and asked her of her case and whether she was a maid as before or whether she had become a woman carnally known by man. she replied, ""o my mother, how should a girl, who hath been sold from merchant to merchant in the land of moslems, a slave commanded, abide a virgin? the merchant who bought me threatened me with the bastinado and violenced me and took my maidenhead, after which he sold me to another and he again to a third."" when the queen heard these her words, the light in her eyes became night and she repeated her confession to the king who was chagrined thereat and his affair was grievous to him. so he expounded her case to his grandees and patricians who said to him, ""o king, she hath been defiled by the moslems and naught will purify her save the striking off of an hundred mohammedan heads."" whereupon the king sent for the true believers he had imprisoned; and they decapitated them, one after another, beginning with the captain, till none was left save nur al-din. they tare off a strip of his skirt and binding his eyes therewith, led him to the rug of blood and were about to smite his neck, when behold, an ancient dame came up to the king at that very moment and said, ""o my lord, thou didst vow to bestow upon each and every church five moslem captives, to held us in the service thereof, so allah would restore thee thy daughter the princess miriam; and now she is restored to thee, so do thou fulfil thy vow."" the king replied, ""o my mother, by the virtue of the messiah and the veritable faith, there remaineth to me of the prisoners but this one captive, whom they are about to put to death: so take him with thee to help in the service of the church, till there come to me more prisoners of the moslems, when i will send thee other four. hadst thou come earlier, before they hewed off the heads of these, i had given thee as many as thou wouldest have."" the old woman thanked the king for his boon and wished him continuance of life, glory and prosperity. then without loss of time she went up to nur al-din, whom she raised from the rug of blood; and, looking narrowly at him saw a comely youth and a dainty, with a delicate skin and a face like the moon at her full; whereupon she carried him to the church and said to him, ""o my son, doff these clothes which are upon thee, for they are fit only for the service of the sultan."" so saying the ancient dame brought him a gown and hood of black wool and a broad girdle, in which she clad and cowled him; and, after binding on his belt, bade him do the service of the church. accordingly, he served the church seven days, at the end of which time behold, the old woman came up to him and said, ""o moslem, don thy silken dress and take these ten dirhams and go out forthright and divert thyself abroad this day, and tarry not here a single moment, lest thou lose thy life."" quoth he, ""what is to do, o my mother?""; and quoth she, ""know, o my son, that the king's daughter, the princess miriam the girdle-girl, hath a mind to visit the church this day, to seek a blessing by pilgrimage and to make oblation thereto, a douceur of thank-offering for her deliverance from the land of the moslems and in fulfilment of the vows she vowed to the messiah, so he would save her. with her are four hundred damsels, not one of whom but is perfect in beauty and loveliness and all of them are daughters of wazirs and emirs and grandees: they will be here during this very hour and if their eyes fall on thee in this church, they will hew thee in pieces with swords."" thereupon nur al-din took the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, and donning his own dress, went out to the bazar and walked about the city and took his pleasure therein, till he knew its highways and gates,and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-second night, she resumed, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nur al-din, after donning his own dress and taking the ten dirhams from the ancient dame, fared forth to the market streets and wandered about a while till he knew every quarter of the city, after which he returned to the church and saw the princess miriam the girdle-girl, daughter of the king of france come up to the fane, attended by four hundred damsels, high-bosomed maids like moons, amongst whom was the daughter of the one-eyed wazir and those of the emirs and lords of the realm; and she walked in their midst as she were moon among stars. when his eyes fell upon her nur al-din could not contain himself, but cried out from the core of his heart, ""o miriam! o miriam!"" when the damsels heard his outcry they ran at him with swords shining bright like flashes of leven-light and would have slain him forthright. but the princess turned and looking on him, knew him with fullest knowledge, and said to her maidens, ""leave this youth; doubtless he is mad, for the signs of madness be manifest on his face."" when nur al-din heard this, he uncovered his head and rolled his eyes and made signs with his hands and twisted his legs, foaming the while at the mouth. quoth the princess, ""said i not that the poor youth was mad? bring him to me and stand off from him, that i may hear what he saith; for i know the speech of the arabs and will look into his case and see if his madness admit of cure or not."" so they laid hold of him and brought him to her; after which they withdrew to a distance and she said to him, ""hast thou come hither on my account and ventured thy life for my sake and feignest thyself mad?"" he replied, ""o my lady, hast thou not heard the saying of the poet?, 'quoth they, 'thou'rt surely raving mad for her thou lov'st;' and i, 'there is no pleasantness in life but for the mad,' reply. compare my madness with herself for whom i rave; if she accord therewith, then blame me not for that which i aby.'"" miriam replied, ""by allah, o nur al-din, indeed thou hast sinned against thyself, for i warned thee of this before it befell thee: yet wouldst thou not hearken to me, but followest thine own lust: albeit that whereof i gave thee to know i learnt not by means of inspiration nor physiognomy nor dreams, but by eye-witness and very sight; for i saw the one-eyed wazir and knew that he was not come to alexandria but in quest of me."" said he, ""o my lady miriam, we seek refuge with allah from the error of the intelligent!"" then his affliction redoubled on him and he recited this saying, ""pass o'er my fault, for 'tis the wise man's wont of other's sins to take no harsh account; and as all crimes have made my breast their site, so thine all shapes of mercy should unite. who from above would mercy seek to know, should first be merciful to those below."" then nur al-din and princess miriam ceased not from lovers' chiding which to trace would be tedious, relating each to other that which had befallen them and reciting verses and making moan, one to other, of the violence of passion and the pangs of pine and desire, whilst the tears ran down their cheeks like rivers, till there was left them no strength to say a word and so they continued till day deprated and night darkened. now the princess was clad in a green dress, purfled with red gold and broidered with pearls and gems which enhanced her beauty and loveliness and inner grace; and right well quoth the poet of her, ""like the full moon she shineth in garments all of green, with loosened vest and collars and flowing hair beseen. 'what is thy name?' i asked her, and she replied, 'i'm she who roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen. i am the pure white silver, ay, and the gold wherewith the bondsmen from strait prison and dour releasd been.' quoth i, 'i'm all with rigours consumed;' but 'on a rock,' said she, 'such as my heart is, thy plaints are wasted clean.' 'even if thy heart,' i answered, 'be rock in very deed, yet hath god caused fair water well from the rock, i ween.'"" and when night darkened on them the lady miriam went up to her women and asked them, ""have ye locked the door?""; and they answered, ""indeed we have locked it."" so she took them and went with them to a place called the hapel of the lady mary the virgin, mother of light, because the nazarenes hold that there are her heart and soul. the girls betook themselves to prayer for blessings from above and circuited all the church; and when they had made an end of their visitation, the princess turned to them and said, ""i desire to pass the night alone in the virgin's chapel and seek a blessing thereof, for that yearning after it hath betided me, by reason of my long absence in the land of the moslems; and as for you, when ye have made an end of your visitation, do ye sleep whereso ye will."" replied they, ""with love and goodly gree: be it as thou wilt!""; and leaving her alone in the chapel, dispersed about the church and slept. the lady miriam waited till they were out of sight and hearing, then went in search of nur al-din, whom she found sitting in a corner on live coals, awaiting her. he rose and kissed her hands and feet and she sat down and seated him by her side. then she pulled off all that was upon her of raiment and ornaments and fine linen and taking nur al-din in her arms strained him to her bosom. and they ceased not, she and he, from kissing and clipping and strumming to the tune of ""hocus-pocus,"" saying the while, ""how short are the nights of union and the nights of disunion how long are they!"" and reciting these verses, ""o night of union, time's virginal prized,  white star of the nights with auroral dyes, thou garrest dawn after noon to rise  say art thou kohl in morning's eyes, or wast thou slumber to bleared eye lief? o night of parting, how long thy stay  whose latest hours aye the first portray, this endless circle that noways may  show breach till the coming of judgment-day, day when dies the lover of parting-grief."" as they were in this mighty delight and joy engrossing they heard one of the servants of the saint smite the gong upon the roof, to call the folk to the rites of their worship, and he was even as saith the poet, ""i saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway,  who made the fawn at striking going so knowing, eh?' and to my soul, 'what smiting irketh thee the more  striking the gong or striking note of going, say?'"" and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-third night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nur al-din and miriam the girdle-girl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and ornaments; but this was grievous to nur al-din, and his gladness was troubled; the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets, ""i ceasd not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight  and eyes down cast and bit the same with most emphatic bite; until we were in gloria and lay him down the spy  and sank his eyes within his brain declining further sight: and struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were like  muezzin crying duty-prayers in allah's book indite. then rose she up right hastily and donned the dress she'd doffed  sore fearing lest a shooting-star upon our heads alight. and cried, 'o wish and will of me, o end of all my hopes!  behold the morning comes to us in brightest whitest light.' i swear if but one day of rule were given to my life  and i were made an emperor of majesty and might, adown i'd break the buttresses of churches one and all  and by their slaughter rid the earth of every shaveling wight."" then the lady miriam pressed him to her bosom and kissed his cheek and asked him, ""o nur al-din, how long hast thou been in this town?"" ""seven days."" ""hast thou walked about in it, and dost thou know its ways and issues and its sea-gates and land gates?"" ""yes!"" ""knowest thou the way to the offertory-chest of the church?"" ""yes!"" ""since thou knowest all this, as soon as the first third of the coming night is over, go to the offertory-chest and take thence what thou wishest and willest. then open the door that giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea, and go down to the harbour, where thou wilt find a little ship and ten men therein, and when the rais shall see thee, he will put out his hand to thee. give him thy hand and he will take thee up into the ship, and do thou wait there till i come to thee. but 'ware and have a care lest sleep overtake thee this night, or thou wilt repent whenas repentance shall avail thee naught."" then the princess farewelled him and going forth from nur al-din, aroused from sleep her women and the rest of the damsels, with whom she betook herself to the church door and knocked; whereupon the ancient dame opened to her and she went forth and found the knights and varlets standing without. they brought her a dapple she-mule and she mounted: whereupon they raised over her head a canopy with curtains of silk, and the knights took hold of the mule's halter. then the guards encompassed her about, drawn brand in hand, and fared on with her, followed by her, till they brought her to the palace of the king her father. meanwhile, nur al-din abode concealed behind the curtain, under cover of which miriam and he had passed the night, till it was broad day, when the main door was opened and the church became full of people. then he mingled with the folk and accosted the old prioress, the guardian of the shrine, who said to him, ""where didst thou lie last night?"" said he, ""in the town as thou badest me."" quoth she, ""o my son, thou hast done the right thing; for, hadst thou nighted in the church, she had slain thee on the foulest wise."" and quoth he, ""praised be allah who hath delivered me from the evil of this night!"" then he busied himself with the service of the church and ceased not busying till day departed and night with darkness starkened when he arose and opened the offertory-chest and took thence of jewels whatso was light of weight and weighty of worth. then he tarried till the first watch of the night was past, when he made his way to the postern of the tunnel and opening it, went forth, calling on allah for protection, and ceased not faring on until, after finding and opening the door, he came to the sea. here he discovered the vessel moored to the shore near the gate; and her skipper, a tall old man of comely aspect with a long beard, standing in the waist, his ten men being ranged before him. nur al-din gave him his hand, as miriam had bidden him, and the captain took it and pulling him on board of the ship cried out to his crew, saying, ""cast off the moorings and put out to sea with us, ere day break."" said one of the ten, ""o my lord the captain, how shall we put out now, when the king hath notified us that to-morrow he will embark in this ship and go round about the sea, being fearful for his daughter miriam from the moslem thieves?"" but the rais cried out at them saying, ""woe to you, o accursed; dare ye gainsay me and bandy words with me?"" so saying the old captain bared his blade and with it dealt the sailor who had spoken a thrust in the throat, that the steel came out gleaming from his nape; and quoth another of the sailors, ""what hath our comrade done of crime, that thou shouldst cut his throat?"" thereupon the captain clapped hand to sword and smote the speaker's head, nor did he leave smiting the rest of the sailors till he had slain them all, one after other, and cast the ten bodies ashore. then he turned to nur al-din and cried out at him with a terrible great cry, that made him tremble, saying, ""go down and pull up the mooring-satke."" nur al-din feared lest he should strike him also with the sword; so he sprang up and leapt ashore and pulling up the stake jumped aboard again, swiftlier than the dazzling leven. the captain ceased not to bid him do this and do that and tack and wear hither and thither and look at the stars, and nur al-din did all that he bade him, with heart a-quaking for affright; whilst he himself spread the sails, and the ship fared with the twain into the dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-fourth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the old skipper had made sail he drave the ship, aided by nur al-din, into the dashing sea before a favouring gale. meanwhile, nur al-din held on to the tackle immersed in deep thought, and drowned in the sea of solicitude, knowing not what was hidden for him in the future; and whenever he looked at the captain, his heart quaked and he knew not whither the rais went with him. he abode thus, preoccupied with care and doubt, till it was high day, when he looked at the skipper and saw him take hold of his long beard and pull at it, whereupon it came off in his hand and nur al-din, examining it, saw that it was but a false beard glued on. so he straitly considered that same rais, and behold, it was the princess miriam, his mistress and the dearling of his heart, who had contrived to waylay the captain and slay him and skinned off his beard, which she had stuck on to her own face. at this nur al-din was transported for you, and his breast broadened and he marvelled at her prowess and the stoutness of her heart and said to her, ""welcome, o my hope and my desire and the end of mine every wish!"" then love and gladness agitated him and he made sure of winning to his hopes and his expectancy; wherefore he broke out into song and chanted these couplets, ""to all who unknown my love for the may  from whom fate disjoins me o say, i pray, 'ask my kith and kin of my love that aye  ensweetens my verses to lovely lay: for the loss of the tribesmen my life o'er sway!' their names when named heal all malady;  cure and chase from heart every pain i dree: and my longings for love reach so high degree  that my sprite is maddened each morn i see, and am grown of the crowd to be saw and say. no blame in them will i e'er espy:  no! nor aught of solace sans them descry: your love hath shot me with pine, and i  bear in heart a flame that shall never die, but fire my liver with fiery ray. all folk my sickness for marvel score  that in darkest night i wake evermore what ails them to torture this heart forlore  and deem right for loving my blood t' outpour: and yethow justly unjust are they! would i wot who 'twas could obtain of you  to wrong a youth who's so fain of you: by my life and by him who made men of you  and the spy tell aught i complain of you he lies, by allah, in foulest way! may the lord my sickness never dispel,  nor ever my heart of its pains be well, what day i regret that in love i fell  or laud any land but wherein ye dwell: wring my heart and ye will or make glad and gay! i have vitals shall ever be true to you  though racked by the rigours not new to you ere this wrong and this right i but sue to you:  do what you will to thrall who to you shall ne'er grudge his life at your feet to lay."" when nur al-din ceased to sing, the princess miriam marvelled at his song and thanked him therefor, saying, ""whoso's case is thus it behoveth him to walk the ways of men and never do the deed of curs and cowards."" now she was stout of heart and cunning in the sailing of ships over the salt sea, and she knew all the winds and their shiftings and every course of the main. so nur al-din said, ""o my lady, hadst thou prolonged this case on me, i had surely died for stress of affright and chagrin, more by token of the fire of passion and love-longing and the cruel pangs of separation."" she laughed at his speech and rising without stay or delay brought out somewhat of food and liquor; and they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves and made merry. then she drew forth rubies and other gems and precious stones and costly trinkets of gold and silver and all manner things of price, light of weight and weighty of worth, which she had taken from the palace of her sire and his treasuries, and displayed them to nur al-din, who rejoiced therein with joy exceeding. all this while the wind blew fair for them and merrily sailed the ship nor ceased sailing till they drew near the city of alexandria and sighted its landmarks, old and new, and pompey's pillar. when they made the port, nur al-din landed forthright and securing the ship to one of the fulling-stones, took somewhat of the treasures that miriam had brought with her, and said to her, ""o my lady, tarry in the ship, against i return and carry thee up into the city in such way as i should wish and will."" quoth she, ""it behoveth that this be done quickly, for tardiness in affairs engendereth repentance."" quoth he, ""there is no tardiness in me;"" and, leaving her in the ship, went up into the city to the house of the druggist his father's old fried, to borrow of his wife for miriam veil and mantilla, and walking boots and petticoat-trousers after the usage of the women of alexandria, unknowing that there was appointed to betide him of the shifts of time, the father of wonders, that which was far beyond his reckoning. thus it befel nur al-din and miriam the girdle-girl; but as regards her sire the king of france, when he arose in the morning, he missed his daughter and questioned her women and her eunuchs of her. answered they, ""o our lord, she went out last night, to go to church and after that we have no tidings of her."" but, as the king talked with them, behold, there arose so great a clamour of cries below the palace, that the place rang thereto, and he said, ""what may be the news?"" the folk replied, ""o king, we have found ten men slain on the sea-shore, and the royal yacht is missing. moreover we saw the postern of the church, which giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea, wide open; and the moslem prisoner, who served in the church, is missing."" quoth the king, ""an my ship be lost, without doubt or dispute.""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-fifth night, she pursued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the king of france missed his daughter they brought him tidings of her, saying, ""thy yacht is lost""; and he replied, ""an the craft be lost, without dispute or doubt my daughter is in it."" so he summoned without stay or delay the captain of the port and cried out at him, saying, ""by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, except thou and thy fighting men overtake my ship forthright and bring it back to me, with those who are therein, i will do thee die the foulest of deaths and make a terrible example of thee!"" thereupon the captain went out from before him, trembling, and betook himself to the ancient dame of the church, to whom said he, 'heardest thou aught from the captive, that was with thee, anent his native land and what countryman he was?"" and she answered, ""he used to say, i come from the town of alexandria."" when the captain heard the old woman's words he returned forthright to the port and cried out to the sailors, ""make ready and set sail."" so they did his bidding and straightway putting out to sea, fared night and day till they sighted the city of alexandria at the very time when nur al-din landed, leaving the princess in the ship. they soon espied the royal yacht and knew her; so they moored their own vessel at a distance therefrom and putting off in a little frigate they had with them, which drew but two cubits of water and in which were an hundred fighting-men, amongst them the one-eyed wazir (for that he was a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil and a wily thief, none could avail against his craft, as he were abu mohammed al-battl), they ceased not rowing till they reached the bark and boarding her, all at once, found none therein save the princess miriam. so they took her and the ship, and returning to their own vessel, after they had landed and waited a long while, set sail forthright for the land of the franks, having accomplished their errand, without a fight or even drawing sword. the wind blew fair for them and they sailed on, without ceasing and with all diligence, till they reached the city of france and landing with the princess miriam carried her to her father, who received her, seated on the throne of his kingship. as soon as he saw her, he said to her, ""woe to thee, o traitress! what ailed thee to leave the faith of thy fathers and forefathers and the safeguard of the messiah, on whom is our reliance, and follow after the faith of the vagrants, to wit, the faith of al-islam, the which arose with the sword against the cross and the images?"" replied miriam, ""i am not at fault, i went out by night to the church, to visit the lady mary and seek a blessing of her, when there fell upon me unawares a band of moslem robbers, who gagged me and bound me fast and carrying me on board the barque, set sail with me for their own country. however, i beguiled them and talked with them of their religion, till they loosed my bonds; and ere i knew it thy men overtook me and delivered me. and by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar and the cross and the crucified thereon, i rejoiced with joy exceeding in my release from them and my bosom broadened and i was glad for my deliverance from the bondage of the moslems!"" rejoined the king, ""thou liest, o whore! o adultress! by the virtue of that which is revealed of prohibition and permission in the manifest evangel, i will assuredly do thee die by the foulest of deaths and make thee the vilest of examples! did it not suffice thee to do as thou didst the first time and put off thy lies upon us, but thou must return upon us with thy deceitful inventions?"" thereupon the king bade kill her and crucify her over the palace gate; but, at that moment the one-eyed wazir, who had long been enamoured of the princess, came in to him and said, ""ho king! saly her not, but give her to me to wife, and i will watch over her with the utmost warding, nor will i go in unto her, till i have built her a palace of solid stone, exceeding high of foundation, so no thieves may avail to climb up to its terrace-roof; and when i have made an end of building it, i will sacrifice thirty moslems before the gate thereof, as an expiatory offering to the messiah for myself and for her."" the king granted his request and bade the priests and monks and patriarchs marry the princess to him; so they did his bidding, whereupon he bade set about building a strong and lofty palace, befitting her rank and the workmen fell to work upon it. on this wise it betided the princess miriam and her sire and the one-eyed wazir; but as regards nur al-din, when he came back with the petticoat-trousers and mantilla and walking boots and all the attire of alexandrian women which he had borrowed of the druggist's wife, he ""found the air void and the fane afar"";and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-sixth night, she resumed, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when nur al-din, ""found the aire void and the fane afar,"" his heart sank within him and he wept floods of tears and recited these verses, ""the phantom of soada came by nigh to wake me towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the desert: but when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, i saw the air vacant, and the place of visitation distant."" then nur al-din walked on along the sea-shore and turned right and left, till he saw folk gathered together on the beach and heard them say, ""o moslems, there remaineth no honour to alexandria-city, since the franks enter it and snatch away those who are therein and return to their own land, at their leisure nor pursued of any of the moslems or fighters for the faith!"" quoth nur al-din to them, ""what is to do?""; and quoth they, ""o my son, one of the ships of the franks, full of armed men, came down but now upon the port and carried off a ship which was moored here, with her that was therein, and made unmolested for their own land."" nur al-din fell down a-swoon, on hearing these words; and when he recovered they questioned him of his case and he told them all that had befallen him first and last; whereupon they all took to reviling him and railing at him, saying, ""why couldst thou not bring her up into the town without mantilla and muffler?"" and all and each of the folk gave him some grievous word, berating him with sharp speech, and shooting at him some shaft or reproach, albeit one said, ""let him be; that which hath befallen him sufficeth him,"" till he again fell down in a fainting-fit. and behold, at this moment, up came the old druggist, who, seeing the folk gathered together, drew near to learn what was the matter and found nur al-din lying a-swoon in their midst. so he sat down at his head and arousing him, said to him as soon as he recovered, ""o my son, what is this case in which i see thee?"" nur al-din said, ""o uncle, i had brought back in a barque my lost slave-girl from her father's city, suffering patiently all i suffered of perils and hardships; and when i came with her to this port, i made the vessel fast to the shore and leaving her therein, repaired to thy dwelling and took of thy consort what was needful for her, that i might bring her up into the town; but the franks came and capturing barque and damsel made off unhindered, and returned to their own land."" now when the shaykh, the druggist, heard this, the light in his eyes became night and he grieved with sore grieving for nur al-din and said to him, ""o my son, why didst thou not bring her out of the ship into the city without mantilla? but speech availeth not at this season; so rise, o my son, and come up with me to the city; haply allah will vouchsafe thee a girl fairer than she, who shall console thee for her. alhamdolillah-praised be allah-who hath not made thee lose aught by her! nay, thou hast gained by her. and bethink thee, o my son, that union and disunion are in the hands of the most high king.."" replied nur al-din, ""by allah, o uncle, i can never be consoled for her loss nor will i ever leave seeking her, though on her account i drink the cup of death!"" rejoined the druggist, ""o my son, and what art thou minded to do?"" quoth nur al-din, ""i am minded to return to the land of the franks and enter the city of france and emperil myself there; come what may, loss of life or gain of life."" quoth the druggist, ""o my son, there is an old saw, 'not always doth the crock escape the shock'; and if they did thee no hurt the first time, belike they will slay thee this time, more by token that they know thee now with full knowledge."" quoth nur al-din, ""o my uncle, let me set out and be slain for the love of her straightway and not die of despair for her loss by slow torments."" now as fate determined there was then a ship in port ready to sail, for its passengers had made an end of their affairs and the sailors had pulled up the mooring-stakes, when nur al-din embarked in her. so they shook out their canvas and relying on the compassionate, put out to sea and sailed many days, with fair wind and weather, till behold, they fell in with certain of the frank cruisers, which were scouring those waters and seizing upon all ships they saw, in their fear for the king's daughter from the moslem corsairs: and as often as they made prize of a moslem ship, they carried all her people to the king of france, who put them to death in fulfilment of the vow he had vowed on account of his daughter miriam. so, seeing the ship wherein was nur al-din they boarded her and taking him and the rest of the company prisoners, to the number of an hundred moslems, carried them to the king and set them between his hands. he bade cut their throats. accordingly they slaughtered them all forthwith, one after another, till there was none left but nur al-din, whom the headsman had left to the last, in pity of his tender age and slender shape. when the king saw him, he knew him right well and said to him, ""art thou not nur al-din, who was with us before?"" said he, ""i was never with thee: and my name is not nur al-din, but ibrahim."" rejoined the king; ""thou liest, thou art nur al-din, he whom i gave to the ancient dame the prioress, to help her in the service of the church."" but nur al-din replied, ""o my lord, my name is ibrahim."" quoth the king, ""wait a while,"" and bade his knights fetch the old woman forthright, saying, ""when she cometh and seeth thee, she will know an thou be nur al-din or not."" at this juncture, behold, in came the one-eyed wazir who had married the princess and kissing the earth before the king said to him, ""know, o king, that the palace is finished; and thou knowest how i vowed to the messiah that, when i had made an end of building it, i would cut thirty moslems' throats before its doors; wherefore i am come to take them of thee, that i may sacrifice them and so fulfil my vow to the messiah. they shall be at my charge, by way of loan, and whenas there come prisoners to my hands, i will give thee other thirty in lieu of them."" replied the king, 'by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, i have but this one captive left!"" and he pointed to nur al-din, saying, ""take him and slaughter him at this very moment and the rest i will send thee when there come to my hands other prisoners of the moslems."" thereupon the one-eyed wazir arose and took nur al-din and carried him to his palace, thinking to slaughter him on the threshold of the gate; but the painters said to him, ""o my lord, we have two days' painting yet to do: so bear with us and delay to cut the throat of this captive, till we have made an end of our work; haply by that time the rest of the thirty will come, so thou mayst despatch them all at one bout and accomplish thy vow in a single day."" thereupon the wazir bade imprison nur al-din.and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-seventh night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the wazir bade imprison nur al-din, they carried him to the stables and left him there in chains, hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself; for indeed he saw death face to face. now it fortuned, by the ordinance of destiny and fore-ordained fate, that the king had two stallions, own brothers, such as the chosroe kings might sigh in vain to possess themselves of one of them; they were called sbik and lhik and one of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome night. and all the kings of the isles had said, ""whoso stealeth us one of these stallions, we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and pearls and gems;"" but none could avail to steal them. now one of them fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes; whereupon the king gathered together all the farriers in the city to treat him; but they all failed of his cure. presently the wazir came into the king; and finding him troubled because of the horse, thought to do away his concern and said to him, ""o king, give me the stallion and i will cure him,"" the king consented and caused carry the horse to the stable wherein nur al-din lay chained; but, when he missed his brother, he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed, so that he affrighted all the folk. the wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the king, who said, ""if this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?"" and he bade his grooms take the other horse and put him with his brother in the wazir's stables, saying, ""tell the minister that the two stallions be a gift from me to him, for the sake of my daughter miriam."" nur al-din was lying in the stable, chained and shackled, when they brought in the two stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes. now he had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases; so he said to himself, ""this by allah is my opportunity! i will go to the wazir and lie to him, saying, 'i will heal thee this horse': then will i do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes, and he will slay me and i shall be at rest from this woe-full life."" so he waited till the wazir entered the stable, to look upon the steed, and said to him, ""o my lord, what will be my due, an i heal this horse, and make his eyes whole again?"" replied the wazir, ""as my head liveth, an thou cure him, i will spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me!"" and nur al-din said, ""o my lord, bid my hands be unbound!"" so the wazir bade unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass, brayed it and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onion-juice. then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up, saying in himself, ""now will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and i shall be at rest from this woe-full life."" then he passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty of cark and care, humbling himself to allah the most high and saying, ""o lord, in thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with asking and craving!"" now when the morning morrowed and the sun shone, the wazir came to the stable and, loosing the bandage from the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than before, by the ordinance of the king who openeth evermore. so he said to nur al-din, ""o moslem, never in the world saw i the like of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge. by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, thou makest me with wonder to admire, for all the farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse!"" then he went up to nur al-din and, doing off his shackles with his own hand, clad him in a costly dress and made him his master of the horse; and he appointed him stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables. so nur al-din abode awhile, eating and drinking and making merry and bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses; and whoso neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service, he would thrown down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron. furthermore, he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand, by reason of that which he knew of their value in the wazir's eyes and his love for them; wherefore the minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast broadened and he was right glad, unknowing what was to be the issue of his case. now in the new palace, which the one-eyed wazir had bought for princess miriam, was a lattice-window overlooking his old house and the flat wherein nur al-din lodged. the wazir had a daughter, a virgin of extreme loveliness, as she were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet, and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold, she heard nur al-din, singing and solacing himself under his sorrows by improvising these verses, ""o my censor who wakest a-morn to see  the joys of life and its jubilee! had the fangs of destiny bitten thee  in such bitter case thou hadst pled this plea, 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' but from fate's despight thou art safe this day;-  from her falsest fay and her crying 'nay!' yet blame him not whom his woes waylay  who distraught shall say in his agony, 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' excuse such lovers in flight abhorr'd  nor to love's distreses thine aid afford: lest thy self be bound by same binding cord  and drink of love's bitterest injury. 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' in his service i wont as the days went by  with freest heart through the nights to lie; nor tasted wake, nor of love aught reckt  ere my heart to subjection summoned he: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' none weet of love and his humbling wrong  save those he sickened so sore, so long, who have lost their wits 'mid the lover-throng  draining bitterest cup by his hard decree: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' how oft in night's gloom he cause wake to rue  lovers' eyne, and from eyelids their sleep withdrew; till tears to the railing of torrents grew,  overflowing cheeks  unconfined and free: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' how many a man he has joyed to steep  in pain, and for pine hath he plundered sleep, made don garb of mourning the deepest deep  and even his dreaming forced to flee: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' how oft sufferance fails me! how bones are wasted  and down my cheeks torrent tear-drops hasted: and embittered she all the food i tasted  however sweet it was wont to be: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' most hapless of men who like me must love,  and must watch when night droops her wing from above, who, swimming the main where affection drove  must sign and sink in that gloomy sea: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' who is he to whom love e'er stinted spite  and who scaped his springes and easy sleight; who free from love lived in life's delight?  where is he can boast of such liberty? 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!' deign lord such suffering wight maintain  then best protector, protect him deign! establish him and his life assain  and defend him from all calamity: 'ah me, for love and his case, ah me: my heart is burnt by the fires i dree!'"" and when nur al-din ended his say and ceased to sing his rhyming lay, the wazir's daughter said to herself, ""by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, verily this moslem is a handsome youth! but doubtless he is a lover separated from his mistress. would heaven i wot an the beloved of this fair one is fair like unto him and if she pine for him as he for her! an she be seemly as he is, it behoveth him to pour forth tears and make moan of passion; but, an she be other than fair, his days are wasted in vain regrets and he is denied the taste of delights.""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say. when it was the eight hundred and eighty-eighth night, she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir's daughter said to herself, ""an his beloved be fair as he, it behoveth him to pour forth tears; and, if other than fair, his heart is wasted in vain regrets!"" now miriam the girdle-girl, the minister's consort, had removed to the new palace the day before and the wazir's daughter knew that she was straitened of breast; so she was minded to seek her and talk with her and tell her the tidings of the young man and the rhymes and verses she had heard him recite; but, before she could carry out her design the princess sent for her to cheer her with her converse. so she went to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down her cheeks; and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she recited these couplets, ""my life is gone but love-longings remain  and my breast is straitened with pine and pain: and my heart for parting to melt is fain  yet hoping that union will come again, and join us in one who now are twain. stint your blame to him who in heart's your thrall  with the wasted frame which his sorrows gall, nor with aim of arrow his heart appal  for parted lover is saddest of all, and love's cup of bitters is sweet to drain!"" quoth the wazir's daughter to her, ""what aileth thee, o princess, to be thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought?"" whereupon miriam recalled the greatness of the delights that were past and recited these two couplets, ""i will bear in patience estrangement of friend  and on cheeks rail tears that like torrents wend: haply allah will solace my sorrow, for he  neath the ribs of unease maketh ease at end."" said the wazir's daughter, ""o princess, let not thy breast be straitened, but come with me straightway to the lattice; for there is with us in the stable a comely young man, slender of shape and sweet of speech, and meseemeth he is a parted lover."" miriam asked, ""and by what sign knowest thou that he is a parted lover?""; and she answered, ""o queen, i know it by his improvising odes and verses all watches of the night and tides of the day."" quoth the princess in herself, ""if what the wazir's daughter says be true, these are assuredly the traits of the baffled, the wretched ali nur al-din. would i knew if indeed he be the youth of whom she speaketh."" at this thought, love-longing and distraction of passion redoubled on her and she rose at once and walking with the maiden to the lattice, looked down upon the stables, where she saw her love and lord nur al-din and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him, knew him with the bestest knowledge of love, albeit he was sick, of the greatness of his affection for her and of the fire of passion, and the anguish of separation and yearning and distraction. sore upon him was emaciation and he was improvising and saying, ""my heart is a thrall; my tears ne'er abate  and their rains the railing of clouds amate; 'twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love;  and whining and pining for dearest mate. ah my burning heat, my desire, my lowe!  for the plagues that torture my heart are eight; and five upon five are in suite of them;  so stand and listen to all i state: mem'ry, madding thoughts, moaning languishment,  stress of longing love, plight disconsolate; in travail, affliction and strangerhood,  and annoy and joy when on her i wait. fail me patience and stay for engrossing care  and sorrows my suffering soul regrate. on my heart the possession of passion grows  o who ask of what fire in my heart's create, why my tears in vitals should kindle flame,  burning heart with ardours insatiate, know, i'm drowned in deluge of tears and my soul  from laz-lowe fares to hwiyah-goal."" when the princess miriam beheld nur al-din and heard his loquence and verse and speech, she made certain that it was indeed her lord nur al-din; but she concealed her case from the wazir's daughter and said to her, ""by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, i thought not thou knewest of my sadness!"" then she arose forthright and withdrawing from the window, returned to her own place, whilst the wazir's daughter went to her own occupations. the princess awaited patiently awhile, then returned to the window and sat there, gazing upon her beloved nur al-din and delighting her eyes with his beauty and inner and outer grace. and indeed, she saw that he was like unto moon at full on fourteenth night; but he was ever sighing with tears never drying, for that he recalled whatso he had been abying. so he recited these couplets, ""i hope for union with my love which i may ne'er obtain  at all, but bitterness of life is all the gain i gain: my tears are likest to the main for ebb and flow of tide;  but when i meet the blamer-wight to staunch my tears i'm fain. woe to the wretch who garred us part by spelling of his spells;  could i but hend his tongue in hand i'd cut his tongue in twain: yet will i never blame the days for whatso deed they did  mingling with merest, purest gall the cup they made me drain! to whom shall i address myself; and whom but you shall seek  a heart left hostage in your court, by you a captive ta'en? who shall avenge my wrongs on you, tyrant despotical  whose tyranny but grows the more, the more i dare complain? i made him regnant of my soul that he the reign assain  but me he wasted wasting too the soul i gave to reign. ho thou, the fawn, whom i so lief erst gathered to my breast  enow of severance tasted i to own its might and main, thou'rt he whose favours joined in one all beauties known to man,  yet i thereon have wasted all my patience' fair domain. i entertained him in my heart whereto he brought unrest  but i am satisfied that i such guest could entertain. my tears for ever flow and flood, likest the surging sea  and would i wot the track to take that i thereto attain. yet sore i fear that i shall die in depths of my chagrin  and must despair for evermore to win the wish i'd win."" when miriam heard the verses of nur al-din the loving-hearted, the parted; they kindled in her vitals a fire of desire, and while her eyes ran over with tears, she recited these two couplets, ""i longed for him i love; but, when we met,  i was amazed nor tongue nor eyes i found. i had got ready volumes of reproach;  but when we met, could syllable no sound."" when nur al-din heard the voice of princess miriam, he knew it and wept bitter tears, saying, ""by allah, this is the chanting of the lady miriam.""and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say. footnotes: i borrow the title from the bresl. edit. x. 204. mr. payne prefers ""ali noureddin and the frank king's daughter."" lane omits also this tale because it resembles ali shar and zumurrud (vol. iv. 187) and al al-din abu al-shmt (vol. iv. 29), ""neither of which is among the text of the collection."" but he has unconsciously omitted one of the highest interest. dr. bacher (germ. orient. soc.) finds the original in charlemagne's daughter emma and his secretary eginhardt as given in grimm's deutsche sagen. i shall note the points of resemblance as the tale proceeds. the correspondence with the king of france may be a garbled account of the letters which passed between harun al-rashid and nicephorus, ""the roman dog."" arab.

""bayt sha'ar""  a house of hair (tent) or a couplet of verse. watad (a tentpeg) also is prosodical, a foot when the two first letters are ""moved"" (vowelled) and the last is jazmated (quiescent), e.g. lakad. it is termed majm'a (united), as opposed to ""mafrk"" (separated), e.g. kabla, when the ""moved"" consonants are disjoined by a quiescent. lit. standing on their heads, which sounds ludicrous enough in english, not in arabic. these lines are in vol. iii. 251. i quote mr. payne who notes ""the bodies of eastern women of the higher classes by dint of continual maceration, esther-fashion, in aromatic oils and essences, would naturally become impregnated with the sweet scents of the cosmetics used."" these lines occur in vol. i. 218: i quote torrens for variety. so we speak of a ""female screw."" the allusion is to the dove-tailing of the pieces. this personification of the lute has occurred before: but i solicit the reader's attention to it; it has a fulness of oriental flavour all its own. i again solicit the reader's attention to the simplicity, the pathos and the beauty of this personification of the lute. ""they"" for she. the arabs very justly make the ""'andalib""  nightingale, masculine. anwr  lights or flowers: see night dccclxv. supra p. 270. these couplets have occurred in vol. i. 168; so i quote mr. payne. i.e. you may have his soul but leave me his body: company with him in the next world and let me have him in this. alluding to the koranic (cxiii. 1.), ""i take refuge with the lord of the daybreak from the mischief of that which he hath created, etc."" this is shown by the first line wherein occurs the koranic word ""ghsik"" (cxiii. 3) which may mean the first darkness when it overspreadeth or the moon when it is eclipsed. ""malak""  level ground; also tract on the nile sea. lane m.e. ii. 417, and bruckhardt nubia 482. this sentiment has often been repeated. the owl comes in because ""bm"" (pron. boom) rhymes with kayym  the eternal. for an incident like this see my pilgrimmage (vol. i. 176). how true to nature the whole scene is; the fond mother excusing her boy and the practical father putting the excuse aside. european paternity, however, would probably exclaim, ""the beast's in liquor!"" in ancient times this seems to have been the universal and perhaps instinctive treatment of the hand that struck a father. by nur al-din's flight the divorce-oath became technically null and void for taj al-din had sworn to mutilate his son next morning. so roderic random and his companions ""sewed their money between the lining and the waistband of their breeches, except some loose silver for immediate expense on the road."" for a description of these purses see pilgrimage i. 37. arab. rashid (our rosetta), a corruption of the coptic trashit; ever famous for the stone. for a parallel passage in praise of alexandria see vol. i. 290, etc. the editor or scribe was evidently an egyptian. arab. ""saghr"" (thagr), the opening of the lips showing the teeth. see vol. i. p. 156. iskandariyah, the city of iskandar or alexander the great, whose ""soma"" was attractive to the greeks as the corpse of the prophet daniel afterwards was to the moslems. the choice of site, then occupied only by the pauper village of rhacotis, is one proof of many that the macedonian conqueror had the inspiration of genius. i.e. paid them down. see vol. i. 281; vol. ii. 145. arab. ""baltiyah,"" sonnini's ""bolti"" and nbuleux (because it is dozid-coloured when fried), the labrus niloticus from its labra or large fleshy lips. it lives on the ""leaves of paradise"" hence the flesh is delicate and savoury and it is caught with the pervier or sweep-net in the nile, canals and pools. arab. ""liyyah,"" not a delicate comparison, but exceedingly apt besides rhyming to ""baltiyah."" the cauda of the ""five-quarter sheep, whose tails are so broad and thick that there is as much flesh upon them as upon a quarter of their body,"" must not be confounded with the lank appendage of our english muttons. see i. 25, dr. burnell's linschoten (hakluyt soc. 1885). a variant occurs in vol. ix. 191. arab. ""tars daylami,"" a small shield of bright metal. arab. ""kaukab al-durri,"" see pilgrimage ii. 82. arab. ""kusf"" applied to the moon; khusf being the solar eclipse. may ab lahab's hands perish.   and his wife be a bearer of faggots!"" korau cxi. 184. the allusion is neat. alluding to the angels who shoot down the jinn. see vol. i. 224. the index misprints ""shibh."" for a similar scene see ali shar and zumurrud, vol. iv. 187. i.e. of the girl whom as the sequel shows, her owner had promised not to sell without her consent. this was and is a common practice. see vol. iv. 192. these lines have occurred in vol. iii. p. 303. i quote mr. payne. alluding to the erectio et distensio penis which comes on before dawn in tropical lands and which does not denote any desire for women. some anglo-indians term the symptom signum salutis, others a urine-proud pizzle. arab. ""mohtasib,"" in the maghrib ""mohtab,"" the officer charged with inspecting weights and measures and with punishing fraud in various ways such as nailing the cheat's ears to his shop's shutter, etc. every where in the moslem east the slave holds himself superior to the menial freeman, a fact which i would impress upon the several anti-slavery societies, honest men whose zeal mostly exceeds their knowledge, and whose energy their discretion. these lines, extended to three couplets, occur in vol. iv. 193. i quote mr. payne. ""at this examination (on judgment day) mohammedans also believe that each person will have the book, wherein all the actions of his life are written, delivered to him; which books the righteous will receive in their right hand, and read with great pleasure and satisfaction; but the ungodly will be obliged to take them, against their wills, in their left (koran xvii. xviii. lxix, and lxxxiv.), which will be bound behind their backs, their right hand being tied to their necks."" sale, preliminary discourse; sect. iv. ""whiteness"" (bayz) also meaning lustre, honour. this again occurs in vol. iv. 194. so i quote mr. payne. her impudence is intended to be that of a captive princess. i.e. bent groundwards. see vol. iv. 192. in marocco za'ar is applied to a man with fair skin, red hair and blue eyes (gothic blood?) and the term is not complimentary as ""sultan yazid za'ar."" the lines have occurred before (vol. iv. 194). i quote mr. lane ii. 440. both he and mr. payne have missed the point in ""ba'zu layli"" a certain night when his mistress had left him so lonely. arab. ""raat-hu."" this apparently harmless word suggests one simlar in sound and meaning which gave some trouble in its day. says mohammed in the koran (ii. 98) ""o ye who believe! say not (to the apostle) r'in (look at us) but unzurn (regard us)."" ""r'in"" as pronounced in hebrew means ""our bad one."" by reason of its leanness. in the mac. edit. ""fifty."" for a scene which illustrates this mercantile transaction see my pilgrimage i. 88, and its deduction. ""how often is it our fate, in the west as in the east, to see in bright eyes and to hear from rosy lips an implied, if not an expressed 'why don't you buy me?' or, worse still, 'why can't you buy me?'"" see vol. ii. 165 dragging or trailing the skirts  walking without the usual strut or swagger: here it means assuming the humble manners of a slave in presence of the master. this is the moslem form of ""boycotting"": so amongst early christians they refused to give one another god-speed. amongst hinds it takes the form of refusing ""hukkah (pipe) and water"" which practically makes a man an outcast. in the text the old man expresses the popular contempt for those who borrow and who do not repay. he had evidently not read the essay of elia on the professional borrower. see note p. 273. i.e. the best kind of camels. this first verse has occurred three times. arab. ""surayy"" in dictionaries a dim. of sarw  moderately rich. it may either denote abundance of rain or a number of stars forming a constellation. hence in job (xxxviii. 31) it is called a heap (kmah). pleiads in gr. the stars whereby men sail. this is the eastern idea of the consequence of satisfactory coition which is supposed to be the very seal of love. westerns have run to the other extreme. ""al-rf"" simply means lowland: hence there is a rf in the nile-delta. the word in europe is applied chiefly to the maroccan coast opposite gibraltar (not, as is usually supposed the north-western seaboard) where the berber-shilh race, so famous as the ""rif pirates"" still closes the country to travellers. i.e. upper egypt. these local excellencies of coition are described jocosely rather than anthropologically. see vol. i. 223: i take from torrens, p. 223. for the complete ablution obligatory after copulation before prayers can be said. see vol. vi. 199. arab. ""zunnr,"" the greek  for which, see vol. ii. 215. miriam (arabic maryam), is a christian name, in moslem lands. ab maryam ""mary's father"" (says motarrazi on al-hariri, ass. of alexandria) is a term of contempt, for men are called after sons (e.g. abu zayd), not after daughters. in more modern authors abu maryam is the name of ushers and lesser officials in the kazi's court. this formality, so contrary to our western familiarity after possession, is an especial sign of good breeding amongst arabs and indeed all eastern nations. it reminds us of the ""grand manner"" in europe two hundred years ago, not a trace of which now remains. these lines are in night i. ordered somewhat differently: so i quote torrens (p. 14). i.e. to the return salm""and with thee be peace and the mercy of allah and his blessings!"" see vol. ii. 146. the enslaved princess had recognised her father's wazir and knew that he could have but one object, which being a man of wit and her lord a ""raw laddie,"" he was sure to win. it is quite in moslem manners for the bystanders to force the sale seeing a silly lad reject a most advantageous offer for sentimental reasons. and the owner of the article would be bound by their consent. arab. ""wa'llahi."" ""bi"" is the original particle of swearing, a harf al-jarr (governing the genitive as bi'llhi) and suggesting the idea of adhesion: ""wa"" (noting union) is its substitute in oath-formul and ""ta"" takes the place of wa as ta'llhi. the three-fold forms are combined in a great ""swear."" i.e. of divorcing their own wives. these lines have occurred before: i quote mr. payne. these lines are in night xxvi., vol. i. 275: i quote torrens (p. 277), with a correction for ""when ere."" this should be ""draws his senses from him as one pulls hair out of paste."" rghib and zhid: see vol. v. 141. carolus magnus then held court in paris; but the text evidently alludes to one of the port-cities of provence as marseille which we english will miscall marseilles. here the writer, not the young wife, speaks; but as a tale-teller he says ""hearer""not ""reader."" kayrawn, the arab. form of the greek cyrene which has lately been opened to travellers and has now lost the mystery which enschrouded it. in hafiz and the persian poets it is the embodiment of remoteness and secrecy; as we till the last quarter century spoke of the ""deserts of central africa."" arab. ""'innn"": alluding to all forms of impotence, from dislike, natural deficiency or fascination, the favourite excuse. easterns seldom attribute it to the true cause, weak action of the heart; but the romans knew the truth when they described one of its symptoms as cold feet. ""clino-pedalis, ad venerem invalidus, ab ea antiqua opinione, frigiditatem pedum concubituris admondum officere."" hence st. francis and the bare-footed friars. see glossarium eroticum linguae latin, parisiis, dondey-dupr, mdcccxxvi. i have noted the use of ""island"" for ""land"" in general. so in the european languages of the sixteenth century, insula was used for peninsula, e.g. insula de cori  the corean peninsula. as has been noticed (vol. i. 333), the monocular is famed for mischief and men expect the mischief to come from his blinded eye. here again we have a specimen of ""inverted speech"" (vol. ii. 265); abusive epithets intended for a high compliment, signifying that the man was a tyrant over rebels and a froward devil to the foe. arab. ""bab al-bahr,"" see vol. iii. 281. arab. ""batrikah"" see vol. ii. 89. the templars, knights of malta and other orders half ecclesiastic, half military suggested the application of the term. these lines have occurred in vol. i. 280i quote torrens (p. 283). maryam al-husn containing a double entendre, ""o place of the white doe (rm) of beauty!"" the girl's name was maryam the arab. form of mary, also applied to the b.v. by eastern christians. hence a common name of syrian women is ""husn maryam""  (one endowed with the spiritual beauties of mary: vol. iv. 87). i do not think that the name was ""manufactured by the arab story-tellers after the pattern of their own names (e.g. nur al-din or noureddin, light of the faith, tajeddin, crown of faith, etc.) for the use of their imaginary christian female characters."" i may here remind readers that the bn, which some orientalists will write ""ben,"" is a straight and graceful species of moringa with plentiful and intensely green foliage. arab. ""amd al-sawri""  the pillar of masts, which is still the local name of diocletian's column absurdly named by europeans ""pompey's pillar."" arab. ""batiyah,"" also used as a wine-jar (amphora), a flagon. arab. ""al-kursn,"" evidently from the ital. ""corsaro,"" a runner. so the port. ""cabo corso,"" which we have corrupted to ""cape coast castle"" (gulf of guinea), means the cape of tacking. arab. ""ghurb,"" which europeans turn to ""grab."" arab. ""sayyib"" (thayyib) a rare word: it mostly applies to a woman who leaves her husband after lying once with him. arab. ""batrikah:"" here meaning knights, leaders of armed men as in night dccclxii., supra p. 256, it means ""monks."" i.e. for the service of a temporal monarch. arab. ""sayr""  a broad strip of leather still used by way of girdle amongst certain christian religions in the east. arab. ""halwat al-salmah,"" the sweetmeats offered to friends after returning from a journey or escaping sore peril. see vol. iv. 60. so eginhardt was an erzcapellan and belonged to the ghostly profession. these lines are in vols. iii. 258 and iv. 204. i quote mr. payne. arab. ""firsah,"" lit.  skill in judging of horse flesh (faras) and thence applied, like ""kiyfah,"" to physiognomy. one kri was the first to divine man's future by worldly signs (al-maydni, arab. prov. ii. 132) and the knowledge was hereditary in the tribe mashj. reported to be a ""hadis"" or saying of mohammed, to whom are attributed many such shrewd aphorisms, e.g. ""allah defend us from the ire of the mild (tempered)."" these lines are in vol. i. 126. i quote torrens (p. 120). these lines have occurred before. i quote mr. payne. arab. ""khk-bk,"" an onomatopia like our flip-flap and a host of similar words. this profaning a christian church which contained the relics of the virgin would hugely delight the coffee-house habitus, and the egyptians would be equally flattered to hear that the son of a cairene merchant had made the conquest of a frankish princess royal. that he was an arrant poltroon mattered very little, as his cowardice only set of his charms. i.e. after the rising up of the dead. arab. ""nafsah,"" the precious one i.e. the virgin. arab. ""nks,"" a wooden gong used by eastern christians which were wisely forbidden by the early moslems. i.e. a graceful, slender youth. there is a complicatd pun in this line: made by splitting the word after the fashion of punsters. ""zarbu 'l-nawks""  the striking of the gongs, and ""zarbu 'l naw, ks  striking the departure signal: decide thou (fem. addressed to the nafs, soul or self)"" i have attempted a feeble imitation. the modern italian term of the venereal finish. arab. ""najm al-munkazzi,"" making the envious spy one of the prying jinns at whom is launched the shihb or shooting-star by the angels who prevent them listening at the gates of heaven. see vol. i. 224. arab. ""sandk al-nuzur,"" lit. ""the box of vowed oblations."" this act of sacrilege would find high favour with the auditory. the night consisting like the day of three watches. see vol. i. arab. ""al-khaukhah,"" a word now little used. arab. ""nmsiyah,"" lit. mosquito curtains. arab. ""jwawshiyah,"" see vol. ii. 49. arab. ""kayyimah,"" the fem. of ""kayyim,"" misprinted ""kayim"" in vol. ii. 93. i.e. hadst thou not disclosed thyself. he has one great merit in a coward of not being ashamed for his cowardice; and this is a characteristic of the modern egyptian, whose proverb is, ""he ran away, allah shame him! is better than, he was slain, allah bless him!"" arab. ""ahjar al-kassrn"" nor forgotten. in those days ships anchored in the eastern port of alexandria which is now wholly abandoned on account of the rocky bottom and the dangerous ""levanter,"" which as the gibraltar proverb says ""makes the stones canter."" arab. ""hakk""  rights, a word much and variously used. to express the possessive ""mine"" a badawi says ""hakki"" (pron. haggi) and ""ll;"" a syrian ""sht"" for shayyati, my little thing or ""taba 'i"" my dependent; an egyptian ""bit' i"" my portion and a maghribi ""m't 'i"" and ""diyyli"" (di allaz l  this that is to me). thus ""mine"" becomes a shibboleth. i.e. the ""good for nothing,"" the ""bad'un;"" not some forgotten ruffian of the day, but the hero of a tale antedating the nights in their present form. see terminal essay, x. ii. i.e. hoping to catch nur al-din. arab. ""sawwhn""  the wanderers, pilgrims, wandering arabs, whose religion, al-islam, so styled by its christain opponents. and yet the new creed was at once accepted by whole regions of christians, and mauritania, which had rejected roman paganism and gothic christianity. this was e.g. syria and the so-called ""holy land,"" not because, as is fondly asserted by christians, al-islam was forced upon them by the sword, but on account of its fulfilling a need, its supplying a higher belief, unity as opposed to plurality, and its preaching a more manly attitude of mind and a more sensible rule of conduct. arabic still preserves a host of words special to the christian creed; and many of them have been adopted by moslems but with changes of signification. i.e. of things commanded and things prohibited. the writer is thinking of the koran in which there are not a few abrogated injunctions. see below for the allusion. arab. ""kafr""  desert place. it occurs in this couplet, ""wa kabrun harbin fi-makanin kafrin; wa laysa kurba kabri harbin kabrun."" ""harb's corse is quartered in coarse wold accurst; nor close to corse of harb is other corse;"" words made purposely harsh because uttered by a jinni who killed a traveller named ""harb."" so homer:     ."" and pope: ""o'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go, etc."" see preface (p. v.) to captain a. lockett's learned and whimsical volume, ""the muit amil"" etc. calcutta, 1814. these lines have occurred vol. iv. 267. i quote mr. lane. the topethesia is here designedly made absurd. alexandria was one of the first cities taken by the moslems (a.h. 21  642) and the christian pirates preferred attacking weaker places, rosetta and damietta. arab. ""bild al-rm,"" here and elsewhere applied to france. here the last line of p. 324, vol. iv. in the mac. edit. is misplaced and belongs to the next page. arab. ""akhawn shikkn""  brothers german (of men and beasts) born of one father and mother, sire and dam. ""the forerunner"" and ""the overtaker,"" terms borrowed from the arab epsom. known to us as ""the web and pin,"" it is a film which affects arab horses in the damp hot regions of malabar and zanzibar and soon blinds them. this equine cataract combined with loin-disease compels men to ride pegu and other ponies. arab. ""zujj bikr"" whose apparent meaning would be glass in the lump and unworked. zaj j bears, however, the meaning of clove-nails (the ripe bud of the clove-shrub) and may possibly apply to one of the manifold ""alfz adwiyh"" (names of drugs). here, however, pounded glass would be all sufficient to blind a horse: it is much used in the east especially for dogs affected by intestinal vermicules. alluding to the arab saying ""the two rests"" (al-rhatni) ""certainty of success or failure,"" as opposed to ""wisws"" when the mind fluctuates in doubt. she falls in love with the groom, thus anticipating the noble self-devotion of miss aurora floyd. arab.

""out upon a prayer who imprecated our parting!"" the use of masculine for feminine has frequently been noted. i have rarely changed the gender or the number the plural being often employed for the singular (vol. i. 98). such change may avoid ""mystification and confusion"" but this is the very purpose of the substitution which must be preserved if ""local colour"" is to be respected.embed"

8,"names of people: the duchesse de guermantes  saint-loup at doncires  mme. de villeparisis at home  my grandmothers illness  bergottes illness  the duke and the doctor  decline and death of my grandmother. the twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to franoise. every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. in other words, we had moved. certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. now she faced even silence with a strained attention. and as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a franoise in exile. and so if i had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was so well respected on all sides and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the use of combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand i, who found it as hard to assimilate new as i found it easy to abandon old conditions, i felt myself drawn towards our old servant when i saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. she alone could understand what i was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of ones surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. and so, without giving him a thought, i went straight to franoise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. the sensibility claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. franoise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if i were in pain would turn her head from me so that i should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. it was the same as soon as i tried to speak to her about our new house. moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while i, as a result of it, had still a temperature, and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, franoise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a days journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a kings ransom, not if you were to offer her millions  a pure hypothesis  and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and usual offices) was much better fitted up in the new house. which, it is high time now that the reader should be told  and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air  was a flat forming part of the htel de guermantes. at the age when a name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which mme. de guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams. and yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy mlusine should disappear. then the name, beneath our successive restorations of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. but let a sensation from a bygone year  like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them  enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. for a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name guermantes, resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of mile. percepieds marriage, brings back to me that mauve  so delicate, almost too bright, too new  with which the billowy scarf of the young duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. and the name guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when i come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, i breathe the air of the combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. but even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name. what form was assumed in my mind by this name guermantes when my first nurse  knowing no more, probably, than i know to-day in whose honour it had been composed  sang me to sleep with that old ditty, gloire  la marquise de guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran marchal de guermantes, making my nursery-maids bosom swell with pride, stopped in the champs-elyses to remark: a fine child that! and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, i cannot, of course, now say. those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; i can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born  from the accounts given me by other people. but more recently i find in the period of that names occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. and, with mme. de guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. a dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place  right at the end of that guermantes way along which, on so many summer afternoons, i retraced with my parents the course of the vivonne  to that land of bubbling streams where the duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over france when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise notre dame of paris and notre dame of chartres, when on the summit of the hill of laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the ark of the deluge on the summit of mount ararat, crowded with patriarchs and judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of god were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of champagne; when the traveller who left beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. it was, this guermantes, like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which i could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; i recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of parnassus or of helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions  in the realm of topographical science  required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. i saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of germany, italy and france; vast territories in the north, strong cities in the south, assembled there to group themselves in guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. i had heard of the famous tapestries of guermantes, i could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, i might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in paris with mme. de guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. but then i had met saint-loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. they had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. the village of guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. as for the tapestries, they were by boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in adrianople and plush. by these revelations saint-loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. and so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding mme. de guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in paris, the htel de guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. as the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this htel de guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the duchess, but these intimates on whom i had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased. in the parties which she gave, since i could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in dresden china which was madame de guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. then, after saint-loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousins chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the htel de guermantes had become  as the louvre might have been in days gone by  a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. but this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside mme. de villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by mme. de guermantes in a wing of the htel. it was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour  whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord  is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemakers, for instance, or a tailors, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a comtesse who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porters lodge (with, by the coachmans side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porters children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same. in the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a duchess, smart and still quite young. she was, in fact, mme. de guermantes and, thanks to franoise, i soon came to know all about her household. for the guermantes (to whom franoise regularly alluded as the people below, or downstairs) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did mammas hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: look at that, now; a pair of holy sisters; thatll be for downstairs, surely; or, oh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the duke will have been out with his gun! until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: theyre having company down below; gay doings, ill be bound; whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance. but the moment in the life of the guermantes which excited the keenest interest in franoise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the duchess stepped into her carriage. it was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. for franoise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible  though by no means legible  to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. she would enlarge upon them, too, in a running aside, but not so that we could catch her words. she called this practice  which, she imagined, must be infuriating, mortifying as she herself put it,vexing to us saying low masses all the blessed day. the last rites accomplished, franoise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank her young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: come, maam, a drop more of the grape; its dlicious to-day, and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in this wretched kitchen. dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at combray. ah! combray, combray! she cried. and the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. if so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own south-country; do we not indeed constantly meet savoyards and bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the southerner? ah, combray, when shall i look on thee again, poor land! when shall i pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. and even then he makes out i dont come quick enough; youd need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if youre a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. alas, poor combray; maybe i shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. and so, nevermore shall i smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. but in the sleep of death i dare say i shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world. her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on mme. de villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in franchises affections. having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbours attention, in order to bid her good day. the coquetry of the young girl that franoise had once been softened and refined for m. jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe mammas orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her a whole chapter from the mistress. she pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: a fine pair, eh! though what she actually muttered was: what an old rattle-trap! but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout: you could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, i dare say, only you dont care for that sort of thing. and franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: tastes differ, you know; simplicitys the rule in this house, shut the window again in case mamma should come in. these you who might have had more horses than the guermantes were ourselves, but jupien was right in saying you since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, franoise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed  with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on sundays when she paid a visit to her niece  the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. and so it can be understood that franoise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my fathers claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called wearying, wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. franoises wearying had soon been cured by none other than jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. very good class, those juliens, (for franoise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) very worthy people; you can see it written on their faces. jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. this new friend of franoise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the government offices. a waistcoat-maker first of all, with the chit of a girl whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on mme. de villeparisis) had turned to ladies fashions and become a seamstress. a prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmakers workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. after this, jupiens presence in the place had ceased to matter. no doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. but with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. and so jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. he was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. his appointment to the regular establishment was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help franoise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. at the same time, and without underrating his value to franoise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, i am bound to say that my first impression of jupien had been far from favourable. at a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. there resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a royal personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. jupiens (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), i soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. the most gifted people that i had known had died young. and so i was convinced that jupiens life would soon be cut short. kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. but his part in the life of franoise had soon ceased to be indispensable. she had learned to put up with understudies. indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, franoise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for mammas answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we did not have any particular thing, it was because we had no wish for it. if she made such a point of other peoples knowing that we had money (for she knew nothing of what saint-loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply have money, fetch water), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. she distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the others attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches. as soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly  otherwise mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her every conceivable insult franoise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table. there are some guermantes who stay in the rue de la chaise, began my fathers valet; i had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. and i know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the army with one of the baron de guermantess stud grooms. does your mother know youre out? added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms. franoise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. she smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: always the same, that victor! and she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin  if remotely  to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the republic was about to enforce against the clergy. franoise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant. the duchess must be connected with all that lot, said franoise, bringing the conversation back to the guermantes of the rue de la chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. i cant recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the duke. its the same kindred, anyway. ay, theyre a great family, the guermantes! she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as pascal founds the truth of religion on reason and on the authority of the scriptures. for since there was but the single word great to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. i wonder now if it wouldnt be them that have their castle at guermantes, not a score of miles from combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at algiers, too. my mother and i long asked ourselves who this cousin at algiers could be until finally we discovered that franoise meant by the name algiers the town of angers. what is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. franoise, who knew the name algiers from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the new year, had never heard of angers. her language, like the french language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. i meant to talk to their butler about it. what is it again you call him? she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: oh, of course, its antoine you call him! as though antoine had been a title. hes the one who could tell me, but hes quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, youd say theyd cut his tongue out, or that hed forgotten to learn to speak. he makes no response when you talk to him, went on franoise, who used make response in the same sense as mme. de svign. but, she added, quite untruthfully, so long as i know whats boiling in my pot, i dont bother my head about whats in other peoples. whatever he is, hes not a catholic. besides, hes not a courageous man. (this criticism might have led one to suppose that franoise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. but it was not so. courageous meant simply a hard worker.) they do say, too, that hes thievish as a magpie, but it doesnt do to believe all one hears. the servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the duchess against them. but its safe to say that hes a real twister, that antoine, and his antoinesse is no better, concluded franoise, who, in furnishing the name antoine with a feminine ending that would designate the butlers wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. if so, she was not far wrong. there is still a street near notre-dame called rue chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male canons) by those frenchmen of olden days of whom franoise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. she proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: but one thing sure and certain is that its the duchess that has guermantes castle. and its she that is the lady mayoress down in those parts. thats always something. i can well believe that it is something, came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony. you think so, do you, my boy, you think its something? why, for folk like them to be mayor and mayoress, its just thank you for nothing. ah, if it was mine, that guermantes castle, you wouldnt see me setting foot in paris, i can tell you. im sure a family whove got something to go on with, like monsieur and madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to combray the moment theyre free to start, and no one hindering them. why do they put off retiring? theyve got everything they want. why wait till theyre dead? ah, if i had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time id have of it at home in my brothers poor old house at combray. down there you do feel youre alive; you havent all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more. that must indeed be fine! exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to combray as the gondola is to venice. a more recent arrival in the household than my fathers valet, he used to talk to franoise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. and franoise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the housekeeper, that peculiar tenderness which princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a highness. at any rate one knows what ones about, there, and what time of year it is. it isnt like here where you wont find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy easter any more than you would at christmas, and i cant hear so much as the tiniest anglus ring when i lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. down there, you can hear every hour; theres only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: my brother will be coming in from the field now, and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. but here its daytime and its nighttime, and you go to bed, and you cant say any more than the dumb beasts what youve been about all day. i gather msglise is a fine place, too, madame, broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention msglise. oh! msglise, is it? said franoise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names  msglise, combray, tansonville. they were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself. yes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is msglise; she went on with a tinkling laugh, but how did you ever come to hear tell of msglise? how did i hear of msglise? but its a well-known place; people have told me about it  yes, over and over again, he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed. i can tell you, its better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day. she spoke to them even of eulalie as a good person. for since eulalies death franoise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to put on airs. it no longer pained her that eulalie had so skilfully managed, sunday after sunday, to secure her trifle from my aunt. as for the latter, franoise never left off singing her praises. but it was at combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of madame? asked the young footman. yes, with mme. octave  oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish. (franoise used the word pity in the sense given it by labruyre.) it was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years. (this reflection was not really a slur upon us, for franoise belonged to an epoch when the words damages was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) ah, i can tell you, people didnt go empty away from that house. as his reverence the cur has told us, manys the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the throne of god, it was she. poor madame, i can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: you know, franoise, i can eat nothing myself, but i want it all to be just as nice for the others as if i could. they werent for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. if youd only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasnt that much of her. she would never listen to a word i said, she would never send for the doctor. ah, it wasnt in that house that youd have to gobble down your dinner. she liked her servants to be fed properly. here, its been just the same again to-day; we havent had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes. what annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. she was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her dancing. i can tell you frankly, the young footman assured her, that i never saw the like. he said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. yes, yes, the butler muttered, but that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in canada, and the minister told monsieur the other evening that hes clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it. there was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. he did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my fathers immediately turning him out of the house. but the philosophy of combray made it impossible for franoise to expect that the strikes in canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. so long as the world goes round, look, therell be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding. in disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as franoise in reckoning the duration of the latters dinner) had been saying: what on earth can they be doing? theyve been at least two hours at their dinner. and she rang timidly three or four times. franoise, her footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. and so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, franoise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: theyve got the jumps to-day, surely, going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence. despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, franoise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that i did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and i realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. but just as elstir, when the bay of balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earths surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by whistler in his harmonies in blue and silver, so the name guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of franoises hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the duchess: she is the first lady in the faubourg saint-germain; hers is the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain. no doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn i had dreamed. and yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation. and it became all the more essential that i should be able to explore in the drawing-room of mme. de guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since i did not find it in her person when i saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. once before, indeed, in the church at combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. and yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had i lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. but now, frequently, i saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if i did not succeed in integrating in her the name guermantes, i cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that i demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. thus mme. de guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; i had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, i would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. but as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so i assured myself that, had i been given the right of entry into mme. de guermantess house, were i one of her friends, were i to penetrate into her life, i should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my fathers friend had said that the guermantes set was something quite by itself in the faubourg saint-germain. the life which i supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, i felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that i could not have imagined the presence, at the duchesss parties, of people in whose company i myself had already been, of people who really existed. for not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that i knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that i had already lived. which was impossible. it was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the presence of our lords body in the host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, i could hear its carpets being beaten. but the line of demarcation that separated me from the faubourg saint-germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. i felt clearly that it was already part of the faubourg, when i saw the guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. for the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which i could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the faubourg saint-germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the faubourg saint-germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of mme. de guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the faubourg saint-germain. no doubt elsewhere than in the faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. but here, in the leading house in the faubourg saint-german, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. they were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that mme. de guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the apostles in the sainte-chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the holy table. as for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings mme. de guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could i not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs  endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa  without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the faubourg saint-germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of figuig without thereby being necessarily in africa. only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the faubourg saint-germain, never probably should i be permitted to set my feet among them. and i must content myself with a shiver of excitement as i sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore. but if the htel de guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. more than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of jupiens shop, whereupon jupien, to the dukes indignation, demanded compensation. if it were only in consideration of all the good that madame la duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish, said m. de guermantes, it is an outrage on this fellows part to claim a penny from us. but jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what good the duchess had ever done. and yet she did do good, but  since one cannot do good to everybody at once  the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. from other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the duke  and this over a considerable area  to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. after seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the champs-elyses. m. de guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the baron and baronne de norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. they were the nephew and niece of the old ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. they had not been long in the place; jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting m. de guermantes, called him m. norpois, not being certain of his name. monsieur norpois, indeed! oh, that really is good! just wait a little! this individual will be calling you comrade norpois next! exclaimed m. de guermantes, turning to the baron. he was at last able to vent his spleen against jupien who addressed him as monsieur, instead of monsieur le duc. one day when m. de guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. after that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesans or courtiers shamelessness, that he, the duc de guermantes, made no bargain about my fathers right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. he had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? and besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the duchess in the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that i was to go and see her, and, remembering that i had been intending to go in for literature, had added that i should meet several authors there. but my father felt that i was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good. as one of mme. de guermantess footmen was in the habit of talking to franoise, i picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which i saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable? to-night theres a big party with a chinese shadow show at the princesse de parmes, said the footman, but we shant be going, because at five oclock madame is taking the train to chantilly, to spend a few days with the due daumale; but itll be the ladys maid and valet that are going with her. im to stay here. she wont be at all pleased, the princesse de parme wont, thats four times already shes written to madame la duchesse. then you wont be going down to guermantes castle this year? its the first time we shant be going there: its because of the dukes rheumatics, the doctor says hes not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but weve been there every year till now, right on to january. if the hot pipes arent ready, perhaps madame will go for a few days to cannes, to the duchesse de guise, but nothings settled yet. and to the theatre, do you go, sometimes? we go now and then to the opra, usually on the evenings when the princesse de parme has her box, thats once a week; it seems its a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes madames friends take, one one night, another another, often with the princesse de guermantes, the dukes cousins lady. shes sister to the duke of bavaria. and so youve got to run upstairs again now, have you? went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat franoise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. you enjoy good health, maam. oh, if it wasnt for these cursed legs of mine! on the plain i can still get along (on the plain meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where franoise had no objection to walking, in other words on a plane surface) but its these stairs that do me in, devil take them. good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening. she was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of france, be very strongly implanted still in her people. for franoise, to whom you might speak of the genius of napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the duc de guermantes was generally called prince dolron, would at once exclaim: thats fine, that is! and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church. franoise learned also from the prince dagrigentes valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the marquis de saint-loup to mlle. dambresac, and that it was practically settled. that villa, that opera-box, into which mme. de guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. the names of guise, of parme, of guermantes-baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. if they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of mme. de guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. each of them gave to the life of the duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. the duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the mediterranean at carnival time, but, in the villa of mme. de guise, where the queen of parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the princesse de parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the princesse de guermantes. as we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that persons life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from franoise that mme. de guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the princesse de parme, i saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the faubourg saint-germain that i saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre. my father had a friend at the ministry, one a. j. moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, a.j. well, somehow or other, this a. j. found himself entitled to a stall at the opra-comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as berma, whom i had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of phdre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me. to tell the truth, i attached no importance to this possibility of hearing berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. and it was not without a sense of melancholy that i realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time i had put before health, comfort, everything. it was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. but my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that i had brought to bear the inner faith i had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of berma, the counterpart that i possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. this art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. no deep-lying soul inhabited it any more. that evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, i was climbing the grand staircase of the opera, i saw in front of me a man whom i took at first for m. de charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff i saw that i had been mistaken, but i had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. for, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or big business a strongly marked difference. where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. it is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy bankers son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the austrian emperor, the prince of saxony, who happened to be in paris at the time. i knew him to be a great friend of the guermantes. as i reached the attendant i heard the prince of saxony (or his double) say with a smile: i dont know the number; it was my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box. he may well have been the prince of saxony; it was perhaps of the duchesse de guermantes (whom, in that event, i should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousins box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box, so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word box and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. i had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but i kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the prince of saxony and was on his way to join the duchesse de guermantes. and, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the greek warrior in the hour of battle. i took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from phdre which i could not quite remember. in the form in which i repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as i made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. it would not have surprised me to learn that i must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. but suddenly i remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the waters brink. and, after all, this excrescence with which i had been struggling consisted of but a single foot. a certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. and it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the princesse de parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew. next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. they went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. which was the exact opposite of what did happen. a budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive  avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the hebrews in the red sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. on the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little cafs, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds. at first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck  like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see  the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of henri iv on a dark background, the bent profile of the due daumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming monseigneur must allow me to take his coat, to which the prince replied, oh, come, come! really, madame dambresac. she took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured. but in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. for the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. they leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. but of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the princesse de guermantes. like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. at once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyons nest. over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the south seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the princesss eyes. the beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. but the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness. thats the princesse de guermantes, said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word princesse with a string of ps, to shew that a title like that was absurd. she hasnt been sparing with her pearls. im sure, if i had as many as that, i wouldnt make such a display of them; it doesnt look at all well, not to my mind. and yet, when they caught sight of the princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. indeed, with the duchesse de luxembourg, with mme. de morienval, with mme. de saint-euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. these features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. but like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of mme. de guermantes-bavire, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the princess in her palaces in munich and in paris. our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that i had heard any mention of the princesse de guermantes-bavire, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. i was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that i saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. certainly i was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. i understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. for all i knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for i saw her smile): do have one, wont you? what mattered that to me? i should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of mrime or meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: thanks; i should like a cherry. and i should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from le mari de la dbutante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, i suppose, meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive. that fat fellow is the marquis de gananay, came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind. the marquis de palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. no one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. but now, because the act ofphdre in which berma was playing was due to start, the princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, i saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. and in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the princess, ceasing to be a nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of zare, or perhaps of orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row i saw that the soft halcyons nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was  downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise. but now my gaze was diverted from the princesse de guermantess box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. at length the curtain went up. i could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which i would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, i kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to africa, to the west indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when i trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artists part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when i should not have believed that i was watching it in the most perfect conditions had i not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which i then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. phdre, the declaration scene, berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, i must go to meet them, i should penetrate what i could of them, and if i opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent i should still absorb but a very little of them. but how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that i myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities, phdre and the way in which berma spoke her part. steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), i was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. and a time had come when, ill as i was, even if i had believed that i should die of it, i should still have been compelled to go and hear berma. but now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which i took cognisance because i was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people i knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of phdre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of french poetry, of which they were merely a part. i felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. the day on which i rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which i ought to have started for venice, or that on which i did go to hear berma, or start for balbec, that i felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then i might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which i would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. i discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which i had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. in the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. and even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, i might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which i would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while i sat reading all afternoon in the garden at combray, lay the thought of perfection. i no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which i had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of aricie, ismne and hippolyte. it was not that the players  they were the same, by the way  did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. their intonations bade the voice: be gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo; or else, now wax furious, and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. but it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter. similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: be majestic. but each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. at this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed: not a hand! did you ever see such a get-up? shes too old; she cant play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago. amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. this fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. but the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against berma. the latter had just corne on to the stage. and then  oh, the miracle  like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life  the talent of berma, which had evaded me when i sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, i deducted, so to speak, from what i heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as phdre, which i had myself studied beforehand so that i might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of mme. berma. but this talent which i sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. so with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. the intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of aricie, ismne or hippolyte i had been able to distinguish, but phdre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. bermas voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of aricie or ismne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. bermas arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. so bermas interpretation was, around racines work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius. my own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. only, i no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and i understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. it had just occurred to me that if i had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of berma, it was because, as earlier still when i used to meet gilberte in the champs-elyses, i had come to her with too strong a desire. between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. the impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. we have brought to it the ideas of beauty, breadth of style, pathos and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a correct face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. it hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. it asks itself: is that good? is what i am feeling just now admiration? is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength? and what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for breadth of interpretation. and for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression. this was precisely what bermas acting shewed me. this was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. now i could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of mars, venus, saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. we feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. it was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that i had had to cross when, that afternoon on which i went first to bear berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, i had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of nobility of interpretation, of originality, and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that i found in saying to myself: at last i am listening to berma. and the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. wherefore we fail to recognise them. i had found no pleasure in listening to berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing gilberte). i had said to myself: well, i do not admire this. but then i was thinking only of mastering the secret of bermas acting, i was preoccupied with that alone, i was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. i understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration. this genius of which bermas rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of racine and nothing more? i thought so at first. i was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from phdre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. the piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time i had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. but i had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. besides, at every fresh passage which, i felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past i added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the authors other works. and this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of phdre. not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. but berma was as sublime in one as in the other. i realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom i had met at balbec, elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. and as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. no doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and bermas diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? but berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of racine berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter. i had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate bermas attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. i realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. i did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear berma again. i was satisfied with her; it was when i admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were gilberte or berma, that i demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterdays impression had refused to afford me. without seeking to analyse the joy which i had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, i said to myself, as in the old days i might have said to one of my schoolfellows: certainly, i put berma first! not without a confused feeling that bermas genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a first place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me. just as the curtain was rising on this second play i looked up at mme. de guermantess box. the princess was in the act  by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void  of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the duchesse de guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the jockey club  who at that moment, and among them all m. de palancy in particular, were the men whom i should most have liked to be  the familiar good evening of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. i felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could i have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. the duc de guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. one would have said that the duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her exaggerations (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically french and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the duchess thought of her as dressed up, and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the princesss head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively british. but different as their two costumes were, after the princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation. possibly a smile would curve the lips of mme. de guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little tailor-made in her cousins way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. by those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. as, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an arrangement supposed to suggest that of the princesse de guermantes simply made the baronne de morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the duchesse de guermantes only made mme. de cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of ravens feathers stuck vertically in her hair. perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire. the explanation of mme. de cambremers presence on this occasion was that the princesse de parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like mme. de cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. mme. de cambremer never took her eyes off the duchesse and princesse de guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. she had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. but having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which  for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge  she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. this evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young marquis de beausergent, mme. dargencourts brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. he was seated behind mme. de cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. he knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. he often accepted these invitations to go with mme. de cambremer to the play. in the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. if at such moments there swept by him the princesse de guermantes, lightfoot and fair as diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by mme. de cambremers), m. de beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient. had not mme. de cambremer known already that the box belonged to the princess, she could still have told that the duchesse de guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. but simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. mme. de cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. she knew that the duchess was staying on very late at guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. but she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, mme. de guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at combray and so be in paris the same evening. perhaps she has come up from guermantes on purpose to hear berma, thought mme. de cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. and she remembered having heard swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with m. de charlus: the duchess is one of the noblest souls in paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society. for myself, who derived from the names guermantes, bavaria and cond what i imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (i could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), i would rather have had their opinion of phdre than that of the greatest critic in the world. for in his i should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. but what the duchesse and princesse de guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, i imagined with the aid of their names, i endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what i demanded that their opinion of phdre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that i had spent in wandering along the guermantes way. mme. de cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. for my own part, i never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of guermantes and cond, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. the toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which i had seen the princesse de guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousins glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which i would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from juno, and i did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of minerva. and when i turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though i had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the assembly of the gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of heaven. i gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that i myself was unknown to these immortals; the duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for i had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, i suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, i saw a ray illumine them; the duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile. and now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, i went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as i drew level with her, but as though i had not in the least expected to see her. indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, i waited opposite the house. and every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom i was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. for never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as i was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk  and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking  a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. but after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, i betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the duchesss usual route. often before that evening at the theatre i had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine i would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, i caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, i stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; i tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom i followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which i promised myself that i would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. no matter, i was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that i had learned that the streets of paris, like the roads round balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom i had so often sought to evoke from the woods of msglise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging. on coming home from the opra-comique i had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past i had been hoping to meet again the form of mme. de guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousins box. i would follow the course which franoise had told me that the duchess generally took, and i would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom i had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. but in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of mme. de guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. and without exactly knowing what i was doing, i tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which i had long held and which albertines coldness, gisles premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that i brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards i was trying to adapt my memory of the duchess. compared with those ideas my memory of mme. de guermantes at the opra-comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover i had been quite familiar with the ideas long before i came to know mme. de guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, i possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association  exclusive of every other feminine form  with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which i remembered it most clearly that i ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but i did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with mme. de guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really mme. de guermantes; during the few hours in which i was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently i could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams i probably altered it completely, for whenever i saw mme. de guermantes i realised the difference  never twice, as it happened, the same  between what i had imagined and what i saw. and now every morning, certainly at the moment when mme. de guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street i saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair  all the things for which i was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which i had come out to seek, i raised them to look at the duchess at the moment in which we converged, what i saw then were red patches (as to which i knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the phdre evening, acknowledged my salute, which i addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. and yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of mme. de guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that i finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. i had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet i had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what i had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. now i should not even have been able to say what mme. de guermantes was like, by what i recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat. why did i one morning, when i saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that i was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of mme. de guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some egyptian deity? once it was not merely a woman with a birds beak that i saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of mme. de guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. from the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue. one day i had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of mme. de guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycooks shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before i had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, i realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, i was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, i realised suddenly that the movement of her head which i saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom i had supposed that i did not know, was mme. de guermantes, by whom i had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. and sometimes i came upon her as i entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye i loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. for the entire staff of the guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his day out stopped by the duchess to whom this cerberus was betraying him. in view of the whole series of different faces which mme. guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, i felt that it was still mme. de guermantes. what i loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life i would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. she might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions losing their importance for me. i should not myself have felt that mme. de guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had i not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which franoise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. the moment i asked her for my outdoor things i felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. i made no attempt to win her confidence, for i knew that i should not succeed. she had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which i have never been able to fathom. perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the european colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. so, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly mme. de guermantess servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to franoise. my parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than franoise to my person, still i should have been no better off. franoise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. in her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had a place of their own but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. as the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in paris was decorated with the words of franoise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. and she could in paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mothers deathbed, which she still vividly saw. but in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to paris and had entered our service she had acquired  as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired  the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were employers after all. this alteration in franoise character was perhaps inevitable. certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the king at versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a pharaoh or a doge  and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. the life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. but it was actually in details more intimate still that i should have been obliged, if i had dismissed franoise, to keep the same servant. for various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. as, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. of these gaps i knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. but my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. it was from the defects which they invariably acquired that i learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. we had always laughed, my mother and i, at mme. sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like the lower orders or the servant class. but i am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing franoise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular. to return to franoise, i never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her i tried to pretend that on the contrary i had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. for she knew the truth. she refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. she refrained from uttering it, or so at least i long believed, for at that time i still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that i could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than franoise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (if, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) but she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which i was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than franoise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering ones head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. i might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that i said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while i made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by franoise); i ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so i should first have had to be conscious that i myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. when franoise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and i could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. but jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which i learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that i was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that i had tried to insult her in every possible way. these words of jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with franoise so different from that on which i used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, franoise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that i realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. however that might be, this sudden outlet which jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. so far it was only franoise that was revealed, and of her i barely thought. was it the same with all ones social relations? and in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? that was the futures secret. for the present only franoise was concerned. did she sincerely believe what she had said to jupien? had she said it to embroil jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint jupiens girl as her successor? at any rate i realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether franoise loved or lothed me. and thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as i had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information  a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love. i was genuinely in love with mme. de guermantes. the greatest happiness that i could have asked of god would have been that he should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. i imagined her doing so. and indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, i preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me  me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. and when i had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which i should welcome the duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; i had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, i could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner  and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen. i felt that i was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if i had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, mme. de guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. and indeed i could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. i should have had to go away for some time; and for that i had not the heart. i did think of it more than once. i would then tell franoise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. and as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, franoise, borrowing the expression from her daughters vocabulary, used to remark that i was dippy. she did not approve of this; she said that i was always balancing, for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of saint-simon. it is true that she liked it still less when i spoke to her as master to servant. she knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as where there isnt a will. i should never have had the heart to leave paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to mme. de guermantes. this was by no means an impossibility. should i not indeed find myself nearer to her than i was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which i should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if i were to go miles away from mme. de guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what i wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because i should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, i should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. what she did during the mysterious daily life of the guermantes that she was  this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street? the friendship, the admiration that saint-loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. all at once i attached a value to them, i would have liked him to disclose them to mme. de guermantes, i was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. for when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. we are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown. saint-loup had not for a long time been able to come to paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. he had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if i came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving balbec, had caused me so much joy when i had read it on the envelope of the first letter i received from my friend. it was (not so far from balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which  as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see  indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. it was not too far away from paris for me to be able, if i took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. as soon as i realised this, troubled by a painful longing, i had too little will power to decide not to return to paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as i walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. i thought that saint-loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which i should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. one of the guard went to find him, and i waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the november wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six oclock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored. saint-loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; i had not given my name, i was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. oh! what a bore! he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. i have just had a weeks leave, and i shant be off duty again for another week. and, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which i did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship. i say! where are you going to sleep? really, i cant recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the exhibition ground, where theres a show just starting; youll find it beastly crowded. no, youd better go to the htel de flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. it makes quite an old-world residence. saint-loup employed in every connexion the word makes for has the air of, because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. and just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the turns of speech that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of saint-loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. besides, he concluded, the hotel i mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. you will have no neighbours. i quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. no, it is for its appeal to the eye that i recommend it. the rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that. but to me, less of an artist than saint-loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which i used to feel long ago at combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which i felt on the evening of my arrival at balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. saint-loup read all this in my fixed gaze. a lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; youre quite pale; and here am i like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you wont have the heart to look at, even. i know the room theyll put you in; personally i find it most enlivening, but i can quite understand that it wont have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. you mustnt think i dont understand; i dont feel the same myself, but i can put myself in your place. at that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to saint-loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. but his horse at once reared. saint-loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side. yes, he resumed; i assure you that i fully understand; i feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. i am wretched, he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, when i think that if i could have stayed with you to-night, i might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. i can lend you any number of books, but you wont want to read if youre feeling like that. and i shant be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; ive been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me. and he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease. run along and light the fire in my quarters, he called to a trooper who passed us. hurry up; get a move on! after which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship. no! to see you here, in these barracks where i have spent so much time thinking about you, i can scarcely believe my eyes. i must be dreaming. and how are you? better, i hope. you must tell me all about yourself presently. well go up to my room; we mustnt hang about too long on the square, theres the devil of a draught; i dont feel it now myself, but you arent accustomed to it, im afraid of your catching cold. and what about your work; have you started yet? no? you are a quaint fellow! if i had your talent im sure i should be writing morning, noon and night. it amuses you more to do nothing? what a pity it is that its the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, wont. there, and ive clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. her proudhons are in safe keeping. i never part from them. an officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. saint-loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. but he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of saint-loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap. i must just say a word to the captain, whispered saint-loup. be a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. its the second on the right, on the third floor; ill be with you in a minute. and setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the first empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at doncires, and which stood in a square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this napoleonid, place de la rpublique. i started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. i was shewn saint-loups room. i stood for a moment outside its closed door, for i could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; i felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. but it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. it could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. i entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. and even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment i saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if i had been on the other side of a wall i should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. i sat down in the room and waited. liberty hangings and old german stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. it was here, in this banning room, that i could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind saint-loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which i could make out my own and that of the duchesse de guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. i heard the tick of saint-loups watch, which could not be far away. this tick changed its place every moment for i could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. suddenly i caught sight of the watch on the table. then i heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. that is to say, i thought i heard it at this place; i did not hear it there; i saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in saint-loups fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the grandplace of doncires. let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. the dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. the withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. we play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. and in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the other person with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that persons hands. to return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a sovereign were expected to pass. and indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like l boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. the empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. in the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. and when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world. only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. the man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as our lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard  sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. but if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. at other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. and for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an eden, in which sound has not yet been created. the highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of paradise. as sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. they move, halt, become alight of their own accord. of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. in the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. and, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window  be it barracks, church, or town hall  is only so much scenery. if one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence. the silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where i sat waiting was now broken. the door opened and saint-loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in. ah, my dear robert, you make yourself very comfortable here, i said to him; how jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here. and to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness i could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam;  a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness. so youd rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself? saint-loup asked me, smiling. oh, robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it, i pleaded; you know its not possible, and you know how wretched i shall be over there. good! you flatter me! he replied. it occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. and that is precisely what i stopped to ask the captain. and he has given you leave? i cried. he hadnt the slightest objection. oh! i adore him! no; that would be going too far. but now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner, he went on, while i turned away so as to hide my tears. we were several times interrupted by one or other of saint-loups friends coming in. he drove them all out again. get out of here. buzz off! i begged him to let them stay. no, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. besides, i dont want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments ive been looking forward to. but you mustnt think, when i tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. far from it. we have a major here who is a splendid chap. hes given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldnt fail to appreciate. thats not the officer whos given me leave to stay here to-night? no; thank god! the man you adore for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. he is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. there you have his mentality. apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major i was telling you about. no one will speak to him because hes a freemason and doesnt go to confession. the prince de borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. which is pretty fair cheek, when alls said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadnt been for the napoleonic wars. not that he hasnt a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where hes neither flesh nor fowl. he hardly ever shews his face at the jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called prince, added robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the empire. i was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since saint-loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. for this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that i had already had, with mme. de guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom i had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, i could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. later on, when i looked at robert, i noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which i found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. the features of the duchesse de guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of combray, the nose like a falcons beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out  in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin  of roberts face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunts. i saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird. robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. this was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; i ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude  the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. and next morning, when i awoke, i rose and went to cast from saint-loups window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which i had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. and yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, i could see the ground, when i opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. but i knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. in the meantime, i could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. through the transparent curtain of frost i could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. but when i had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when i did not see it, than the hotel at balbec, than our house in paris, of which i thought as of absent  or dead  friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although i was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that i formed at doncires, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by saint-loups batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill  the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of combray. it did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. the hill might expose its grizzled rump to the suns rays, which, an hour later, when i went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as i went, on the pavements from which i could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy. but after that first night i had to sleep at the hotel. and i knew beforehand that i was doomed to find sorrow there. it was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which i usually occupied i was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. but i could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where i preceded him, where i arrived by myself, where i must bring into contact with its environment that self which i rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since combray, since my first arrival at balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk. as it happened, i was mistaken. i had no time to be sad, for i was not left alone for an instant. the fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company  neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that i came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. in short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. one tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. and one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps. if i wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. but the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs i had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the alps to find that the act  as a rule not noticed  of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. i received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when i set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever i knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which i had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. i looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which i felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass  of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the directory  offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if i had been sitting on the hearthrug. the walls held the room in  close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. and the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if i left them open when i withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. this closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom i was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above. before going to bed i decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. i walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if i could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. when i came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply now you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours, while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if i did not sleep that night i could easily come in barefoot, and the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour i chose to come in, i need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. and behind a hanging curtain i surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. i went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. and as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which i was in the habit of drawing. if i had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which i was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which i was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when i turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. it is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. it needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. we awake, look at our watch, see four oclock; it is only four oclock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an emperors orb of gold. in the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the msglise way, i was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. but on several occasions  and i mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea  the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and i heard nothing. on the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. and the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when saint-loup asked me whether i had heard the band, i was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which i heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. perhaps i had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. for often, when i was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, i had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour i imagined that i was awake, while still drowsing, and i enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which i had the illusion of looking on. what one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in ones dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. the same story branches off and has a different ending. when all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. after having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief absence to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less good night. but already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which auto-suggestions prepare  like witches  the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease. not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. at the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: it is seven oclock, she will find us awake and ready. on the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young siegfried. beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in ciceronian dialogues. next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes. sometimes i had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep. that kind of sleep is called sleeping like lead, and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. one is no longer a person. how then, seeking for ones mind, ones personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover ones own self rather than any other? why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterdays that is incarnate in one? one fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays ones hand? what is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption  whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? there has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. no doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? the resurrection at our awakening  after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep  must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. and perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory. when i had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky  but discouraged by the chill  of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, i raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change i was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. i rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which i had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. the walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that i should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. but they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which i saw quite differently from in paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. on certain days, i was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which i had left half-finished in paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, i had managed to become involved. one or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and i was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. then from the hotel i sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to saint-loup: i told him that, should it be materially possible  i knew that it was extremely difficult for him  i should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. an hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door i felt myself liberated from my obsessions. i knew that, if they were stronger than i, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. he had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which i at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions. i hope you werent angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed. not at all; i just supposed you wanted to see me, and i thought it very nice of you. i was delighted that you should have sent for me. but what is the trouble? things not going well? what can i do to help? he listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, i had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; i was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. all my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which saint-loup undertook to dispatch. life seemed to me so different, so delightful; i was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that i longed for action. what are you doing now? i asked him. i must leave you, im afraid; were going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and i have to be on parade. then its been a great bother to you, coming here? no, no bother at all, the captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you i must go at once; but you understand, i dont like to seem to be abusing the privilege. but if i got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where youll be training, it would interest me immensely, and i could perhaps talk to you during the breaks. i shouldnt advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, i assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the dminralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustnt go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as theyve passed i think youll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner. but soon i was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when i began to take an interest in the military theories which saint-loups friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the cafs in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. to reach the training ground i used to have to take tremendously long walks. in the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. next morning i realised that i had no more heard the band than, at balbec, after the evenings on which saint-loup had taken me to dinner at rivebelle, i used to hear the concert on the beach. and at the moment when i wished to rise i had a delicious feeling of incapacity; i felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. i felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because i had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the guermantes walk. poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. but these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. the fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. this is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good nights rest. good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. there is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. what once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. but we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations. sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; i had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. how blessed then was my return to the hotel! as i got into bed i seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the romances beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. my sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. charming; beneficent perhaps also. i reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. these thoughts carried me far. on days when, although there was no parade, saint-loup had to stay in barracks, i used often to go and visit him there. it was a long way; i had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which i had an immense view. a strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. while i waited for robert  he being engaged on some duty or other  outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on i came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, i could hear him discussed by the others, and i soon learned what a popular favourite he was. among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of saint-loups character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on saturday evenings, when they went on pass to paris, they had seen supping in the caf de la paix with the duc duzs and the prince dorlans. and on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress  the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade  they had introduced the idea of a tone which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic captain to whom i had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common. one of them said that the captain had bought a new horse. he can buy as many horses as he likes. i passed saint-loup on sunday morning in the alle des acacias; now hes got some style on a horse! replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. at any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in saint-loup. it gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table serjeant saint-loup. and what a tale there was to tell in barracks on monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in roberts squadron, and to whom he had said how dye do most civilly, while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, saint-loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speakers direction. yes, my brother saw him at the paix, said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; my brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didnt fit him. what was the waistcoat like? he wasnt wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning! to the old soldiers (sons of the soil who had never heard of the jockey club and simply put saint-loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of saint-loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. they recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the stripes in the regiment, manners like no ones else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. the morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon lay-down in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which saint-loup had appeared on parade. it was the height of my pack. come off it, old chap, you dont expect us to believe that; it couldnt have been the height of your pack, interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a learned beggar, and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him. oh, so it wasnt the height of my pack, wasnt it? you measured it, i suppose! i tell you this much, the c. o. glared at it as if hed have liked to put him in clink. but you neednt think the great saint-loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. well see what the capstan has to say when he hears. oh, very likely hell say nothing, but you may be sure he wont be pleased. but theres nothing so wonderful about that cap. i hear hes got thirty of em and more at home, at his house in town. where did you hear that, old man? from our blasted corporal-dog? asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation. where did i hear it? from his batman; what dyou think? ah! now youre talking. thats a chap who knows when hes well off! i should say so! hes got more in his pocket than i have, certain sure! and besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. he wasnt getting his grub properly, he says. along comes de saint-loup, and gives cooky hell: i want him to be properly fed, dyou hear, he says, and i dont care what it costs. the old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success. on leaving the barracks i would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before i went, as i did every evening, to dine with saint-loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, i made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. in the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. so strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step i took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. i seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of mercury. one of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. next door to the hotel, the old national courts and the louis xvi orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the army corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which i went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. i kept, when i was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that i had felt outside. it gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of bergottes novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which i feel that i should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. i thought with joy of the barracks that i had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, i felt that i was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when i kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings i esteemed as a priceless privilege, which i hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever i chose, always certain of a welcome. at seven oclock i dressed myself and went out again to dine with saint-loup at the hotel where he took his meals. i liked to go there on foot. it was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. as i walked, i ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of mme. de guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that i had come to visit roberts garrison. but a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. there are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. then we pay attention to other things. and the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. the life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which i might not penetrate. here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magicians wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. in a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by rembrandt. sometimes i lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. i proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to msglise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, i felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which i then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and i attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. this gothic alley meant for me something so real that if i had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. i thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget mme. de guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. in the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood i could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. i waited to see them, i stood peering in the direction from which i had heard the sound. but i was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. finally the revellers did appear; not, as i had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, i had been as far wrong over direction as over distance. the wind grew stronger. it was thick and bristling with coming snow. i returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants. and sure enough at the hotel where i was to meet saint-loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, i found, as i hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the everlasting fire, an influx (worthy of some numbering of the people before bethlehem such as the old flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. and similarly, in the big dining-room which i crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where  for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when i arrived  they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. one of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the flemish manner), i went straight  at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues  towards this servitor, in whom i felt that i recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. i should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. a young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in primitive paintings, with pointed ends. fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, i explored my way to the smaller room in which saint-loups table was laid. i found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. on the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, i drew saint-loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him: robert, this is hardly the time or the place for what i am going to say, but i shant be a second. i keep on forgetting to ask you when im in the barracks; isnt that mme. de guermantess photograph that you have on your table? why, yes; my good aunt. of course she is; what a fool i am; you told me before that she was; id forgotten all about her being your aunt. i say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, theyre looking at us; another time will do; it isnt at all important. thats all right; go on as long as you like. they can wait. no, no; i do want to be polite to them; theyre so nice; besides, it doesnt really matter in the least, i assure you. do you know that worthy oriane, then? this worthy oriane, as he might have said, that good oriane, did not imply that saint-loup regarded mme. de guermantes as especially good. in this instance the words good, excellent, worthy are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative that, indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. the word good does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon do you see much of her? or i havent set eyes on her for months, or i shall be seeing her on tuesday, or she must be getting on, now, you know. i cant tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because were living in her house now, in paris, and ive been hearing the most astounding things (i should have been hard put to it to say what) about her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, dont you know, from a  how shall i put it  from a balzacian point of view; but youre so clever you can see what i mean; i dont need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners? they will think absolutely nothing; i have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are. you are too kind. but listen, what i want to say is this: i suppose mme. de guermantes hasnt any idea that i know you, has she? i cant say; i havent seen her since the summer, because i havent had any leave since shes been in town. what i was going to say is this: ive been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot. that i do not believe; oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same shes by no means stupid. you know that, as a rule, i dont care about your advertising the good opinion youre kind enough to hold of me; im not conceited. thats why im sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). but mme. de guermantes is different; if you could let her know  if you would even exaggerate a trifle  what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure. why, of course i will, if thats all you want me to do; its not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? i suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if thats all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; im afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and its so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together. it was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which i could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that i had forgotten his connexion with the duchess, and also did not give him time to frame  with regard to my reasons for wishing that mme. de guermantes should know that i was his friend, was clever, and so forth  questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that i should not have been able to answer them. robert, im surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesnt discuss the things that will give ones friends pleasure; one does them. now i, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed i only wish you would ask me to do something for you, i can assure you i shouldnt want any explanations. i may ask you for more than i really want; i have no desire to know mme. de guermantes, but just to test you i ought to have said that i was anxious to dine with mme. de guermantes; i am sure you would never have done it. not only should i have done it, i will do it. when? next time im in paris, three weeks from now, i expect. we shall see; i dare say she wont want to see me, though. i cant tell you how grateful i am. not at all; its nothing. dont say that; its everything in the world, because now i can see what sort of friend you are; whether what i ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether i am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. a stupid friend would have started a discussion. which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps i wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also i was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. then i went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of mme. de guermantess very features which nature had made in producing her nephew robert: but, i say, we mustnt keep them waiting any longer, and ive mentioned only one of the two things i wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but im afraid you will never consent. would it bore you if we were to call each other tu? bore me? my dear fellow! joy! tears of joy! undreamed-of happiness! thank you  tu i mean; you begin first  ever so much. it is such a pleasure to me that you neednt do anything about mme. de guermantes if youd rather not, this is quite enough for me. i can do both. i say, robert! listen to me a minute, i said to him later while we were at dinner. oh, its really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, i cant think why  you remember the lady i was speaking to you about just now. yes. youre quite sure you know who i mean? why, what do you take me for, a village idiot? you wouldnt care to give me her photograph, i suppose? had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. but when the time came to speak i felt shy, i decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion i put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural. no; i should have to ask her permission first, was his answer. he blushed as he spoke. i could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this i hated him. at the same time i was touched to see how differently saint-loup behaved towards me now that i was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. his increased affability would have left me cold had i thought that it was deliberately assumed; but i could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. in our private conversations i might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. the mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughters responses and to the attitude of the public. if i had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a whats that? to make me repeat what i had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. so that i caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror. it occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about mme. blandais, but i stopped at once, remembering that saint-loup knew it already, and that when i had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: you told me that before, at balbec. i was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. youve forgotten it for the moment, i said to him, but youll remember as i go on. no, really; i swear youre mistaken. youve never told me. do go on. and throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. i realised only after i had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. such is the stuff of friendship. on the third evening, one of his friends, to whom i had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and i overheard him telling saint-loup how much he had been enjoying himself. and indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at balbec, that feeling which saint-loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. and yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. i could not help asking robert when he spoke to me about balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry mlle. dambresac. he assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. if at that moment i had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of mlle. dambresac to some one who was not saint-loup and that of saint-loup to some one who was not mlle. dambresac. i should have surprised them greatly had i reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. in order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long. saint-loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of dreyfus. just as a brother of this friend of saint-loup, who had been trained at the schola cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when i told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a mentality, as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of dreyfusards in general and of bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. similarly one of saint-loups cousins had married a young eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as victor hugos or alfred de vignys, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an eastern princess immured in an arabian nights palace. for the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of alfred de vigny or victor hugo. that fellow? oh, hes not like saint-loup, hes a regular devil, my new friend informed me; hes not even straight about it. at first, he used to say: just wait a little, theres a man i know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, general de boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision. but as soon as he heard that boisdeffre had pronounced dreyfus guilty, boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of saussier, and he, a soldier of the republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. but when saussier pronounced esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to dreyfus but to general saussier. it was the militarist spirit that blinded saussier (and i must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; i dont know what to think of him now). his family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas. dont you think, i suggested, turning half towards saint-loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, that the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. one is the man of ones idea. there are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. as there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it. at this point i was interrupted by saint-loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: duroc! duroc all over! i had no idea what this might mean, but i felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. while i was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to saint-loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. and just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: gibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. you can tell us about it afterwards. and to me: please go on. i gave a sigh of relief, for i had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again. and as an idea, i went on, is a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations. when i had finished, thats one in the eye for you, my boys, exclaimed saint-loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if i had been walking upon a tight-rope. what were you going to say, gibergue? i was just saying that your friend reminded me of major duroc. i seemed to hear him speaking. why, ive often thought so myself, replied saint-loup; they have several points in common, but youll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that duroc hasnt got. saint-loup was not satisfied with this comparison. in an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: youre the cleverest man i know, do you hear? he corrected himself, and added: you and elstir.  you dont mind my bracketing him with you, i hope. you understand  punctiliousness. its like this: i say it to you as one might have said to balzac: you are the greatest novelist of the century  you and stendhal. excessive punctiliousness, dont you know, and at heart an immense admiration. no? you dont admit stendhal? he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. oh, good! i see youre on my side; bloch cant stand stendhal. i think its idiotic of him. the chartreuse is after all an immense work, dont you think? i am so glad you agree with me. what is it you like best in thechartreuse, answer me? he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. and the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. mosca? fabrice? i answered timidly that mosca reminded me a little of m. de norpois. whereupon peals of laughter from the young siegfried saint-loup. and while i was going on to explain: but mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic, i heard robert cry: bravo! actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: oh, perfect! admirable! you really are astounding. i took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all roberts friends and to robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, i had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom i saw in the square when i went to visit saint-loup, or, if i was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. i should have liked to know more about the major whom saint-loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me even from an aesthetic point of view. i knew that with robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. unfortunately, from the military point of view robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of dreyfus. he spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. a firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of dreyfus and retained his admiration for picquart. in the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. for, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former chief of the intelligence branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. however this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid saint-loup the compliment of telling him  in the tone in which a catholic lady might tell a jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain israelites  that their colonel was not, with regard to dreyfusism  to a certain kind of dreyfusism, at least  the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be. i am not surprised, was saint-loups comment; for hes a sensible man. but in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. now, he turned to me, major duroc, the lecturer on military history i was telling you about; theres a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so im told. and i should have been surprised to hear that he wasnt, for hes not only a brilliantly clever man, but a radical-socialist and a freemason. partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of saint-loups faith in dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, i asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. it is absolutely true. but what do you mean by that? well, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. so that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind. give me an example or two, if you dont mind. it is not very easy to explain, saint-loup broke in. you read, let us say, that this or that corps has tried    but before we go any further, the serial number of the corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. if it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. next, we must ask ourselves what was this corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemys, which gives to the operation on which this corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. and then, the serial number of the corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. if, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. you can understand that if, in the analysis of the corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. one must study what i may call the whole geographical context, he added with a laugh. and indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. while the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. an exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (which was a classic feint in napoleons wars.) on the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the higher command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. we are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. if, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the higher command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from headquarters. and there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. so that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. but just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. observe that i am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall i call it?) spatial identity of battles. that exists also. a battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. if it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. and so what it has been it will continue to be. a painter doesnt make a studio out of any old room; so you dont make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. there are places set apart for the purpose. but, once again, this is not what i was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. battles like ulm, lodi, leipzig, cannae. i cant say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commanders part) a cannae, an austerlitz, a rosbach, a waterloo. some of our people say quite openly that marshal von schieffer and general falkenhausen have prepared a battle of cannae against france, in the hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through belgium, while bernhardi prefers the oblique order of frederick the great, lenthen rather than cannae. others expound their views less crudely, but i can tell you one thing, my boy, that beauconseil, the squadron commander i introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. the break through in the centre at rivoli, too; thats a thing that will crop up if theres ever another war. its no more obsolete than the iliad. i must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we cant afford to repeat the mistake we made in seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. the only thing that troubles me is that if i see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, i mean mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. it is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory. the enunciation of these theories by saint-loup made me happy. they gave me to hope that perhaps i was not being led astray, in my life at doncires, with regard to these officers whom i used to hear being discussed while i sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while i was at balbec the king and queen of the south sea island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, legrandins brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. what gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that i still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which i had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, saint-loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that i might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after i had left doncires i should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. at the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word: you interest me  i beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously, i said to saint-loup, but tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. i feel that i could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so i must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. you tell me that plans of battles are copied. i do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, i cant tell you how attractive it sounds. but then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? does he really do no more than apply the rules? or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait? i should just say so! you will find napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. for instance, look at austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to lannes. but you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of napoleons movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. there are a dozen examples of that in 1870. but even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. it is his instinct, his divination  like mme. de thbes (you follow me?) which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. thus ive been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. but it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. if i had time now to go through the napoleonic wars from this point of view, i assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal  no, i know youre not well, i apologise!  well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the higher command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. i may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. in reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march. now you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago. not at all. you remember that book of philosophy we read together at balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. very well. it is the same again with the art of strategy. in a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. and here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. for of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. he may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what i call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. but it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what i call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. thus at ulm, mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. my example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. and ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. but it doesnt much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. to go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician poincar is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. as to the rules themselves, which i mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. we cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the field service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major i was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially. saint-loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next field service will shew signs of this evolution, put in my other neighbour. i am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine, said saint-loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. perhaps i may have underestimated the importance of the rules; i dont know. they do change, that must be admitted. but in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. if they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. all this is a little too technical for you, he remarked to me. after all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. in the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. but all that is a thing of the past. with the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed. dont be so touchy, i told saint-loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. i was listening to you quite eagerly. if you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak, his friend went on, i shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. it may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the prussian guard at saint-privat, and the turcos at froeschviller and wissembourg. ah! interchangeable; very neat! excellent! the lad has brains, was saint-loups comment. i was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, i was afforded a glimpse of the general law. still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, i was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to saint-loup, was quite possible and had been done by napoleon more than once. and to understand what military worth meant i asked for comparisons between the various generals whom i knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature. i felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of mme. de guermantes, by the hospitality of saint-loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. they gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by bernard palissy. i am jealous, furious, saint-loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which i had been having with his friend. is it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? well, i suppose hes everything now, and no one else is to have a look in! men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture. when the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to dreyfus for fear of offending saint-loup. the following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. the reason is, i suggested, not wishing to enter into details, that the influence of environment is not so important as people think     i intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which i had made to saint-loup a few days earlier. since, however, i had repeated these words almost textually, i proceeded to excuse myself by adding: as, in fact, i was saying the other day     but i had reckoned without the reverse side of roberts polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. that admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. and so, in the matter of my modest theory, saint-loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though i were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval. why, yes; environment is of no importance. and with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him: the real influence is that of ones intellectual environment! one is the man of ones idea! he stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare: all men with similar ideas are alike, he informed me, with a challenging air. probably he had completely forgotten that i myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well. i did not arrive at saint-loups restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. if a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. there were evenings when, as i passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, i felt so keen a longing for mme. de guermantes that i could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. and however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for ones entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of ones body. only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. at the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. i would look up at the sky. if it were clear, i would say to myself: perhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all i know, when i arrive at the restaurant robert may say to me: good news! i have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here. it was not in the firmament alone that i enshrined the thought of mme. de guermantes, a passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from gilberte in the cornfields of msglise. we do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. what brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that i knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. simply because i thought that i recognised sorrows which i had felt on gilbertes account, or else when in the evenings at combray mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of bergotte, in the agony i now felt, to which mme. de guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, i did not conclude that mme. de guermantes was not the cause of that agony. is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? and yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. as i made my way to the restaurant i said to myself: a fortnight already since i last saw mme. de guermantes. a fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when mme. de guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. for me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which i felt that i could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the duchess again. and i was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. one day i said to myself: perhaps there will be a letter to-night; and on entering the dining-room i found courage to ask saint-loup: you dont happen to have had any news from paris? yes, he replied gloomily; bad news. i breathed a sigh of relief when i realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. but i soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt. i learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. and the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. for she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. to say that saint-loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. when he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. what he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at doncires, or have sailed for the indies. it has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. it increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? it has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. but what a torture  keener than that of having to keep silence  to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! robert asked himself: what can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? she hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me. and he reproached himself. thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. an immaterial enclosure, i admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. he saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: the letter! the letter! after this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end. he suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. and inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. but his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. he forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. he contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at doncires, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a ladys maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. these communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, roberts mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of versailles. meanwhile he, down at doncires, no longer slept a wink all night. once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. but suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: i hear her; you shant    you shant.     he awoke. he had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. his host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. saint-loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. and suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. he had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. and the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, robert said, he would never be able to forget. it was an idiotic dream, he concluded, still quite breathless. all the same i could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. my father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but i doubt whether that would have been of much use to saint-loup. besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between saint-loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. his bad dream began to fade from his memory. with a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take. at length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. as soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. he did not hesitate for long. and perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to paris at the new year. now he had not the heart to go to paris without seeing her. on the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which captain de borodino was unwilling to grant. im sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. i dare say i shall be in paris at easter. we shant be able to call on mme. de guermantes then, because i shall have gone to balbec. but, really, it doesnt matter in the least, i assure you. to balbec? but you didnt go there till august. i know; but next year theyre making me go there earlier, for my health. all that he feared was that i might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. she is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. but she is a sublime creature. you cant imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. she goes every year to spend all souls day at bruges. nice of her, dont you think? if you ever do meet her youll see what i mean; she has a greatness.     and, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: there is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what i mean, the poet merging into the priest. i was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable saint-loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to paris. now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that i had to see some more pictures by elstir, the famous painter whom saint-loup and i had met at balbec. a pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to elstir, what i had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would i have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which i had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what i wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by elstir. it seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. his work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, i had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (i had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of japanese art. several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. a certain house at les andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which elstirs pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, i felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to mme. de guermantes. so that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which saint-loup told me of his ladys projected visit to bruges, i was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment: listen, if you dont mind. just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. you remember elstir, the painter i met at balbec? why, of course i do. you remember how much i admired his work? i do, quite well; and the letter we sent him. very well, one of the reasons  not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason  why i should like to meet the said lady  you do know who i mean, dont you? of course i do. how involved youre getting. is that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by elstir. i say, i never knew that. elstir will probably be at balbec at easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. i should very much like to have seen this picture before i leave paris. i dont know whether youre on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldnt you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she wont refuse, and then ask her if shell let me come and see the picture without you, since you wont be there? thats all right. ill answer for her; ill make a special point of it. oh, robert, you are an angel; i do love you. its very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do. i hope its not your departure that you two are plotting together, one of roberts friends said to me. you know, if saint-loup does go on leave, it neednt make any difference, we shall still be here. it will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but well do all we can to make you forget his absence. as a matter of fact, just as we had decided that roberts mistress would have to go to bruges by herself, the news came that captain de borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for serjeant saint-loup to proceed on long leave to bruges. what had happened was this. the prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under napoleon iiis barber. captain de borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. but the hairdresser, through whose books the princes account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of portugal and eau des souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for saint-loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. having learned of saint-loups vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. this narrative of a young mans gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of bonapartish indulgence. it is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barbers recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. while his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. as for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to saint-loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to robert again. all his friends assured me that, as long as i stayed at doncires, or if i should come there again at any time, even although robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and i felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness. why on earth, they went on, after insisting that i should stay, dont you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! besides youre so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier. for i continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names i knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, i used to make the other boys classify the actors of the thtre-franais. if, in the place of one of the generals whom i had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as galliffet or ngrier, one of saint-loups friends, with a contemptuous: but ngrier is one of the feeblest of our general officers, put the new, intact, appetising name of pau or geslin de bourgogne, i felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of thiron or febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of amaury. better even than ngrier? but in what respect; give me an example? i should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and i hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. the one whom i should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom i had most often seen, was the prince de borodino. but neither saint-loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include m. de borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards saint-loup. the others, taking advantage of the fact that robert was only an n.c.o., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. captain de borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with robert. the fact was that the prince, whose grandfather had been made a marshal and a prince-duke by the emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of napoleon iii and had twice been a minister after the coup detat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with saint-loup and the guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. he suspected that, for saint-loup, he himself was  he, a kinsman of the hohenzollern  not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded saint-loup as the son of a man whose countship had been confirmed by the emperor  one of what were known in the faubourg saint-germain as touched-up counts  and who had besought him first for a prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to his highness the prince de borodino, minister of state, who was styled on his letters monseigneur and was a nephew of the sovereign. something more than a nephew, possibly. the first princesse de borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on napoleon i, whom she followed to the isle of elba, and the second hers on napoleon iii. and if, in the captains placid countenance, one caught a trace of napoleon i if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask  the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of napoleon iii; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after sedan, to join the emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused. if the prince de borodino was not prepared to make overtures to saint-loup nor to the other representatives of faubourg saint-germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. and so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of saint-loup, the prince de borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by marshal x  confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which saint-loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at doncires, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. i had no difficulty that evening, as i watched saint-loup sitting at his captains table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the empire. the offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, saint-loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the strangers name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him my dear fellow. belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the prince de borodino  not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally  regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom saint-loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. this was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great embassies, and the court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of saint-loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a rouher and a fould. son, doubtless, or grandson of an emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of m. de borodino. but as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. it was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. when he passed in plain clothes through the streets of doncires, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-majors office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by berthier and massna. when he chose the cloth for his squadrons breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling talleyrand and deceiving alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new prussia and a new italy. but a moment later, reverting from napoleon iii to napoleon i, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the mens rations. and at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue svres, fit for an ambassador (which had been given to his father by napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. and, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the prince had at doncires, it may be as well to add these few words. the lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officers wife sang like a conservatoire medallist. this latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with m. de borodino. they were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the prince went to paris on leave he dined with mme. de pourtals, and the murats, and people like that. but, they said to themselves, hes just a captain, after all; hes only too glad to get us to come. still, hes a real friend, you know. but when m. de borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer paris, was posted to beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the doncires theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. one morning, saint-loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between paris and doncires, she might make use of it to speak to me. in short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. the telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. and yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and i almost decided to lodge a complaint. like all of us nowadays i found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmothers case, paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. and we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. we need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke  occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, i admit  the vigilant virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our guardian angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the all powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the danaids of the unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: i hear you!; the ever infuriated servants of the mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the invisible, the young ladies of the telephone. and, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound  the sound of distance overcome  and the voice of the dear one speaks to us. it is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. but how remote it is! how often have i been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, i felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. a real presence indeed that voice so near  in actual separation. but a premonition also of an eternal separation! over and again, as i listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and i have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which i was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words i would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust. this afternoon, alas, at doncires, the miracle did not occur. when i reached the post office, my grandmothers call had already been received; i stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when i raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like punchinello; i silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like punchinello, as soon as i took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. at length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, i stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then i spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly i heard that voice which i supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, i had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself i was hearing this afternoon for the first time. and because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, i discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. it was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost  more than any but a few human voices can ever have been  of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, i noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime. was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. the orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that i felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that i would stay at doncires altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what i held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. my grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. this freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which i had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when i should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). granny! i cried to her, granny! and would fain have kissed her, but i had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. speak to me! but then it happened that, left more solitary still, i ceased to catch the sound of her voice. my grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; i continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which i felt that her appeals also must be straying. i was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, i had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, i had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that i was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which i was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. it seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that i had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, i went on vainly repeating: granny, granny! as orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as i was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to paris, i wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. and yet, before reaching this decision, i felt i must make one attempt more to invoke the daughters of the night, the messengers of the word, the deities without form or feature; but the capricious guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was captain de borodinos nephew); gutenberg and wagram left their supplications unanswered, and i came away, feeling that the invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear. when i came among robert and his friends, i withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. saint-loup appeared to believe me, but i learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. and while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, i certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings i had derived from the friendship of the former and the latters distant passage. and yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. my departure overpowered me less when i was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when i felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, roberts brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between doncires and paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return. i dont doubt the truth of what youre saying, or that you arent thinking of leaving us just yet, said saint-loup, smiling; but pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise theres a risk of my not seeing you; im going out to luncheon, ive got leave from the captain; i shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. i suppose the man to whose house im going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time. scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. i ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. the word trunks recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. i was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. the office was closing for the night. finally i got my connexion. is that you, granny? a womans voice, with a strong english accent, answered: yes, but i dont know your voice. neither did i recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. and then all was explained. the young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. this call coming on the very day on which i had been telephoning to my grandmother, i had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error. the following morning i rose late, and failed to catch saint-loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. about half past one, i had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as i was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, i noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an n.c.o. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was saint-loup. by his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom i had met once before at the hotel where we dined. i did not dare shout to robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, i attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. i knew that robert was short-sighted; still, i should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. i ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when i arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which i was not allowed to stand, and i was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to saint-loup; i went up to his room, but he had gone; i was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the old soldiers, who were watching the regiment parade. you havent seen serjeant saint-loup, have you, by any chance? i asked. hes gone on parade, sir, said the old soldier. i never saw him, said the graduate. you never saw him, exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, you never saw our famous saint-loup, the figure hes cutting with his new breeches! when the capstan sees that, officers cloth, my word! oh, youre a wonder, you are; officers cloth, replied the young graduate, who, reported sick in quarters, was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. this officers cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it? sir? asked the old soldier angrily. he was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches being made of officers cloth, but, being a breton, coming from a village that went by the name of penguern-stereden, having learned french with as much difficulty as if it had been english or german, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying sir? to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation. ah! it is cloth like that, he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. ah! it is cloth like that; when i tell you that it is, officers cloth, when-i-tell-you-a-thing, if-i-tell-you-a-thing, its because i know, i should think. very well, then; replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. keep your hair on, old boy. there, look, theres the capstan coming along. no, but just look at saint-loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. would you call that a non-com? and his eyeglass; oh, hes hot stuff, he is. i asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether i too might look out of the window. they neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. i saw captain de borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the battle of austerlitz. a few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as i was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. i was wretched at not having said good-bye to saint-loup, but i went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when i thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, i had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, i had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what i had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as i had once before imagined mamma in a house by herself, when i had left her to go to balbec. alas, this phantom was just what i did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, i found her there, reading. i was in the room, or rather i was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. of myself  thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of ones own absence  there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. the process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when i caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. we never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. how, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother i had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could i have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. but if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. so is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. and, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of egypt, i, for whom my grandmother was still myself, i who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say hes begun to age a good deal, for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, i saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom i did not know. my request to be allowed to inspect the elstirs in mme. de guermantess collection had been met by saint-loup with: i will answer for her. and indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. we answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. no doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another persons nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. but these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. and so with the actions which before our minds eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. one of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which saint-loup still did not come to paris, his aunt, to whom i had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the elstirs. i perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. this was jupien. did he consider that i ought to have gone in and said how dye do to him, on my return from doncires, before even going upstairs to our own flat? my mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. franoise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. these invariably passed off after a little time. meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. one morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, i heard in my chimney  instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea  the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. that morning, i was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which i had been going to florence and venice. so profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom i was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing. i quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to balbec that on my arrival there i had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before i knew it; that at florence or parma or venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when i looked at the sights there. i realised this. similarly, one new years afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, i had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. and yet i could not prevent my memory of the time during which i had looked forward to spending easter in florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the city of flowers, to give at once to easter day something florentine and to florence something paschal. easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of holy week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun. the weather had now become milder. and my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. i had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting mme. de guermantes. but it was for this very reason that i kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with mme. de guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, i should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning. alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, i felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. it happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. but the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. and she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. and so, even when i had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, i trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, i would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides. she was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. i said to myself that the woman whom i could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; i saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that i should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painters brush. and when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. on one of these lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, i met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. the face of mme. de guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. i was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. the gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which i did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some saint of the early ages of christianity. after which i felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. but, after all, the streets are public. the streets are public, i reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of italy, the duchesse de guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. as i had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. there is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. but in these afternoon hours both were lacking. before going to sleep, i devoted so much time to thinking that i should not be able to sleep, that even after i was asleep a little of my thought remained. it was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that i could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that i had had the idea that i was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening    to a fresh doze in which i was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when i was asleep, i had imagined that i was not asleep. these shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen  and quite useless  delicacy of perception to seize them all. similarly, in later years, at venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, i have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. one of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. in my sleep i saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. an arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. this dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which i longed to attain, in which i believed that i was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that i had often dreamed it before. but as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, i supposed that i was mistaken. i noticed, however, that i did frequently have this dream. the limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; i could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. i, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while i dreamed, as soon as i tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; i wanted to go to them, and i could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly i was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. so, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which giotto has portrayed envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which swann had given me photographs. saint-loup came to paris for a few hours only. he came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. shes not being at all nice just now, oriane isnt, he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. shes not my old oriane any longer, theyve gone and changed her. i assure you, its not worth while bothering your head about her. you pay her far too great a compliment. you wouldnt care to meet my cousin poictiers? he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. quite an intelligent young woman, she is; youd like her. shes married to my cousin, the duc de poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. ive told her about you. she said i was to bring you to see her. shes much better looking than oriane, and younger, too. really a nice person, dont you know, really a good sort. these were expressions recently  and all the more ardently  taken up by robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. i dont go so far as to say shes a dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: if he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the devils isle. you see what i mean, dont you? and then shes the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; shes given orders that theyre never to be sent in by the servants stair, when they come to the house. shes a very good sort, i assure you. the real reason why oriane doesnt like her is that she feels shes the cleverer of the two. although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the guermantes footmen  who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge  franoise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of saint-loups visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. she never failed to go out on the days when i most wanted her. it was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in paris. the intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that i felt at being deprived of her services, for i had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at saint-andr-des-champs. and so i never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way franoise had of saying not: i have been to see my brother, or i have been to see my niece, but i have been to see the brother, i just looked in as i passed to bid good day to the niece (or to my niece the butcheress). as for her daughter, franoise would have been glad to see her return to combray. but this recent parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of the intran. she was still less willing to go to franchises sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for mountains, said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, arent really interesting. she could not make up her mind to go back to msglise, where the people are so stupid, where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say why, its never poor bazireaus daughter? she would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had tasted the life of paris, and franoise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new parisian when she said: very well, mother, if you dont get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu. the weather had turned chilly again. go out? what for? to catch your death? said franoise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at combray. being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt lonie  a natural philosopher  franoise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: it is the remnant of the wrath of god! but i responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already i could see the morning sun shine on the slope of fiesole, i warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. it was not only the bells that came from italy, italy had come with them. my faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which i ought to have made long ago, for since, here in paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the ponte vecchio. my father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend a. j., where m. de norpois was going when he met him about the place. its to see mme. de villeparisis, they are great friends; i never knew anything about it. it seems shes a delightful person, a most superior woman. you ought to go and call on her, he told me. another thing that surprised me very much. he spoke to me of m. de guermantes as quite a distinguished man; i had always taken him for a boor. it seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only hes very proud of his name and his connexions. but for that matter, according to norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over europe. it appears, the austrian emperor and the tsar treat him just like one of themselves. old norpois told me that mme. de villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. he paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. for youre not likely to do anything else; i can see that. it might turn out quite a good career; its not what i should have chosen for you, myself; but youll be a man in no time now, we shant always be here to look after you, and we mustnt prevent you from following your vocation. if only i had been able to start writing! but whatever the conditions in which i approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. i was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if i offered them no resistance, if i contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, i escaped without serious injury, i slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, i read a little, i did not over-exert myself; but if i attempted to thwart them, if i pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, i was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and i vowed that another time i would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered. my father, in the meantime, had met m. de guermantes once or twice, and, now that m. de norpois had told him that the duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. as it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed mme. de villeparisis. he tells me, shes his aunt; viparisi, he pronounces it. he tells me, too, shes an extraordinarily able woman. in fact he said she kept a school of wit, my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. my mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that mme. de villeparisis kept a school of wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the marquises intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. my grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. since we had moved into our new flat, mme. de villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. and invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed franoise to lick the envelopes for her. as for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this school of wit, i should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, i eventually did. my father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the ambassadors support would be worth many votes to him at the institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. to tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have m. de norpoiss support, he was by no means certain of it. he had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the ministry that m. de norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my fathers candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. and yet, when m. leroy-beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned m. de norpois. he dared not ask the ambassador point-blank, but hoped that i should return from my call on mme. de villeparisis with his election as good as secured. this call was now imminent. that m. de norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the academy seemed to him all the more probable since the ambassadors willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. and besides, at the ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official. my father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. in the street one day he ran into mme. sazerat, whose life in paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. there was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did mme. sazerat, so much so that mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: my dear, i really must invite mme. sazerat to the house, just once; she wont stay long; and even: listen, dear, i am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon mme. sazerat. you know i hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you. he would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. and so, for all that mme. sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment mme. sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. my father had come home speechless with rage. next day my mother met mme. sazerat in some ones house. she did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all ones relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. now, from all time my parents had accorded to mme. sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. but (and of this my mother was ignorant) mme. sazerat, alone of her kind at combray, was a dreyfusard. my father, a friend of m. mline, was convinced that dreyfus was guilty. he had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. he never spoke to me for a week, after learning that i had chosen to take a different line. his opinions were well known. he came near to being looked upon as a nationalist. as for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. my mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that i might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. finally my grandfather, who adored the army (albeit his duties with the national guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. all this was quite enough to make mme. sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of injustice. we pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. as soon as she knew my father to be an anti-dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between. saint-loup, who was coming anyhow to paris, had promised to take me to mme. de villeparisiss, where i hoped, though i had not said so to him, that we might meet mme. de guermantes. he invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. we were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of paris. i had asked saint-loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which aim had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the balbec season started. it was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of balbec but of balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in paris would be watching, just the same, through the long july afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. i hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with balbec, to have realised here in paris something of the delights of travel. i left the house early, with franoise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. franoise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place. before reaching saint-loups, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, i ran into legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. seeing me, he stopped: ah! so its you, he exclaimed, a man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! that is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. it is true that you are a man of the world, i suppose, and go out paying calls! to go and dream, as i do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. you know how i admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why i tell you how deeply i regret that you should go forth and deny it among the gentiles. by being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere  which i am unable to breathe  of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the prophet. i can see it all, you frequent the light hearts, the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. ah! those aristocrats! the terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. they are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! while you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. the truth is that i scarcely belong to this earth upon which i feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. i belong to a different planet. goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the danube. to prove to you that i am your sincere well-wisher, i am going to send you my last novel. but you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de sicle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. i suppose i am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; i do wrong to put my heart into what i write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of christ: do this and ye shall live. farewell, friend. it was not with any particular resentment against legrandin that i parted from him. certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the vivonne. after coming out of a paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to saint-loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. it was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by nature. the bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. but the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion. it had been a country village, and had kept its old mayors office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. these villages in the environs of paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the follies of the stewards and favourites of the great. a fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that i had seen, formed great quadrilaterals  separated by low walls  of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a palace of the sun, such as one might unearth in crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower. never had robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. she alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. that alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. i do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but i do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. there was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. so nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. if one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, i doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. if he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. for he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. no doubt the general affection called love must have forced him  as it forces all men  to believe at times that she did. but in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really  he thought) to leave him. if she is nice to me to-day, he confided to me, i am going to give her something that shell like. its a necklace she saw at boucherons. its rather too much for me just at present  thirty thousand francs. but, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. she will be jolly pleased with it, i know. she mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. i don t believe that is true, really, but i wasnt taking any risks, so ive arranged with boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. i am glad to think that youre going to meet her; shes nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know, (i could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when i did see her, admire her all the more) what she has got is a marvellous judgment; shell perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by jove! the things shell say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; theres really something about her thats quite pythian. on our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and i was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths. listen; i can see youd rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it, said robert, so just wait for me here, will you; my friends house is quite close, i will go and fetch her. while i waited i strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. if i raised my head i could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. i recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to m. swanns park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. i took a path which led me into a meadow. a cold wind blew keenly along it, as at combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the suns face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the suns rays. suddenly saint-loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman i recognised at once rachel when from the lord, her who, but a few years since  women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change  used to say to the procuress: to-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, wont you? and when they had come round for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the anyone, she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent womans precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound ones chest, never stopping in the process unless the some one, not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patients catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. on this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them i should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, i felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of saint-loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make  out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more  the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. seeing these two elements separately (because i had known rachel when from the lord in a house of ill fame), i realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what rachel was for me. the idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. i could have told robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. and how they would have pained him! and what had he not given to learn them, without avail! i realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girls face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. i saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than ones family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. no doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, robert and i. but we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. that face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, i had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that i asked. and so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. and beneath them i should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. but what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. he gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. that he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. it happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in ones judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying ones chances of platonic love. and it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. as for rachels favours, however, saint-loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge  since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law  from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. the immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. and indeed, when robert and i were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery. it was not rachel when from the lord who seemed to me a small matter  it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these i felt to be vast. robert noticed that i appeared moved. i turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. and it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. these trees that i had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the magdalenes when, in another garden, she saw a human form and thought it was the gardener. treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? i exchanged a few words with saint-loups mistress. we cut across the village. its houses were sordid. but by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. saint-loup drew me a little way in front to explain. i should have liked it if you and i could have been alone together, in fact i would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunts. but this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, dont you know, i hadnt the heart to refuse her. youll like her, however, shes literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides its such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing. i fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. we had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to paris when, at the station, rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little tarts like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: hello, rachel, you come with us; lucienne and germaine are in the train, and theres room for one more. come on. were all going to the rink, and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. they were two poor little tarts with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as rachel must have looked when saint-loup first met her. he did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to rachel, he caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a rachel other than her whom he knew, a rachel like the two little tarts in the train, a twenty-franc rachel. in short, rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own rachel, the little tart rachel, the real rachel, assuming that rachel the tart was more real than the other. it may then have occurred to robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. but how was it to be done? she had done nothing to forfeit his regard. less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. if he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on rachels part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say  and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands  that this was from self-esteem or vanity. saint-loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. no; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in ones own eyes and in other peoples as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. rachel rejoined us, leaving the two tarts to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names lucienne and germaine kept the new rachel alive for a moment longer. for a moment robert imagined a place pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the boulevard de clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. it was almost an unknown paris in the heart of paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. robert longed to ask her who lucienne and germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the olympia tavern, if robert and i had not been there. for a moment the purlieus of the olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the rue caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known robert, rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. but what use was it to ply rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. the porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; rachels magnificent pearls reminded robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto  save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the place pigalle of an impressionist painter  and the train began to move. it was, by the way, quite true that she was literary. she never stopped talking to me about books, new art and tolstoyism except to rebuke saint-loup for drinking so much wine: ah! if you could live with me for a year, wed see a fine change. i should keep you on water and youd be ever so much better. right you are. lets begin now. but you know quite well i have to work all day! for she took her art very seriously. besides, what would your people say? and she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which saint-loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. i, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. tears sprang to the young womans eyes; i had been rash enough to refer to dreyfus. the poor martyr! she almost sobbed; it will be the death of him in that dreadful place. dont upset yourself, zzette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit theyve made a mistake. but long before then hell be dead! oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. but just think of the agony he must be going through; thats what makes my heart bleed. and would you believe that roberts mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the devils isle, even if he is innocent; isnt it appalling? yes, its absolutely true, she does say that, robert assured me. shes my mother, ive no fault to find with her, but its quite clear she hasnt got a sensitive nature, like zzette. as a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be such a pleasure always ended in trouble. for as soon as saint-loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. in fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. and sometimes she found that robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. i could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that robert was looking troubled. the fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, aim, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. the others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of college of augurs. as ill luck would have it, aim having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. aim inquired after my grandmothers health; i asked for news of his wife and children. he gave it with emotion, being a family man. he had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. roberts mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. but aims sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. in the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of prince eugne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. he had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. at the most, some passing parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. and yet aim must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. anyhow, it did not escape robert beneath whose skin i saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused. anything specially interesting about that waiter, zzette? he inquired, after sharply dismissing aim. one would think you were studying the part. there you are, beginning again; i knew it was coming. beginning what again, my dear girl? i may have been mistaken; i havent said anything, im sure. but i have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that i knew him at balbec (otherwise i shouldnt give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesnt walk the face of the earth. she seemed anxious to pacify robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. i found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that i most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as i had heard mme. de villeparisis declare that she had no talent, i attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. she discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. she applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if wagnerian, ah! that is good! one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: yes, as a sensation i call it distinctly good. but what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal. in eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. she recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own. i ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic rachel was too malicious for my liking. she did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration  against saint-loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing rachel attack her  the defence of berma, saying: oh, no, shes a wonderful person, really. of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they dont correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. she has done good work, you know. and besides shes such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesnt care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind. (our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. if it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out ones thumb. but the charming quality of mind is more exacting. it requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) but, with this single exception, saint-loups mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because i believed  quite mistakenly, as it happened  that it was she who was inferior to them. she was clearly aware that i must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. but she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (i was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see saint-loups mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) and so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyones conversation delighted her so much as mine. if we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the palais-royal; they had a look, also, of academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that m. de jussieu might have worn. others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which members of the institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. they were faces well known to all the regular guests. one of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. but presently, perhaps to drive robert away so that she might be alone with aim, rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table. zzette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that, said saint-loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, if you must make a scene here, i shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards. at this point a messenger came up to tell aim that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. saint-loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, m. de charlus. there; you see! he said to me in a low voice, my family hunt me down even here. will you, please  i cant very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and hes certain to give us away  ask him not to go to the carriage. he can ahvays send some other waiter who doesnt know me. i know my uncle; if they tell him that im not known here, hell never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. really, its pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me! aim on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the marquis de saint-loup) that they did not know any such person. but saint-loups mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage. oh, indeed! so its the young man over there, now, is it? thank you for telling me; its a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with ones meals! dont listen to him, please; hes rather cross to-day, and, you know, she went on, turning to me, he just says it because he thinks it smart, that its the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always. and she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation. but, zzette, it is i who find it unpleasant. you are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine youre making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too. oh, no, i think hes charming; for one thing, hes got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women  you can feel he must love them. you can at least keep quiet until ive left the room, if you have lost your senses, cried robert. waiter, my things. i did not know whether i was expected to follow him. no, i want to be alone, he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. his anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. when robert had gone, his mistress called aim and asked him various questions. she then wanted to know what i thought of him. an amusing expression, hasnt he? do you know what i should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. but that would be all. if we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldnt it? its silly of robert to get ideas like that. all that sort of thing, its only just what comes into my head, thats all; robert has nothing to worry about. she was still gazing at aim. do look, what dark eyes he has. i should love to know what there is behind them. presently came a message that robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. i thus found myself alone, until i too was summoned by robert. i found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. they were drinking champagne. hallo, you! she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. i had fed badly, i was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit legrandins words had had no effect on me i was sorry to think that i was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. whereupon i said to myself: i have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young womans company are not wasted, since i have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne. i told myself this because i felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. i ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which i felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that i was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. as for robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. they made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. by dint of drinking champagne with them, i began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication  and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart  lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. the room which saint-loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the jardin de paris. being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, i caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. the joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado i smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. and i felt myself so much under the ephemeral and potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that i am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom i had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that i should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life. robert was annoyed only because i was not being more brilliant before his mistress. what about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, ive forgotten the story, and he watched her furtively. but, my dear boy, theres nothing more than what youve just said. what a bore you are. then tell her about franoise in the champs-elyses. shell enjoy that. oh, do! bobby is always talking about franoise. and taking saint-loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: hallo, you! since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; i amused myself, pretending that what i saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that saint-loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, i saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for i could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part. these ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedians face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us  like the dissolution of a dear friend  begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death. one number in the programme i found extremely trying. a young woman whom rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. this young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. at the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. the unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. the instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. i tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than i had paid to my grandmothers sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. and yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. nevertheless, i preferred not to speak of this incident since i had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy. but the opening scene of this afternoons performance interested me in quite another way. it made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which saint-loup was a victim with regard to rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and i respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. but seen thus, she was another woman. she had one of those faces to which distance  and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre  gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. at a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of rachels attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. this was not my case but it had been saint-loups when he first saw her on the stage. then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm  that in which she lived  from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. he had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. the number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. the golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon rachel before saint-loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. they vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. but she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. and so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in roberts memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. she was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to saint-loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. he loved her already. the need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all ones chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre. when, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, i felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with saint-loup. in this way my attitude, as i did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that i was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that i should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what i appeared to be saying, i was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind: you know, i said, i did come to say good-bye to you the day i left doncires; ive not had an opportunity to mention it. i waved to you in the street. dont speak about it, he replied, i was so sorry. i passed you just outside the barracks, but i couldnt stop because i was late already. i assure you, i felt quite wretched about it. so he had recognised me! i saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. but i was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. i had already observed at balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. in one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute. the stage scenery, still in its place, among which i was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and rachel, when i came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. the curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. it was no longer herself, i recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. the form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. on the other hand  as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold  on this face, so smooth a surface until now, i could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, i was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by goethe in wilhelm meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and i had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with ones eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. but at that moment saint-loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened. you might look the other way, he warned her gloomily. you know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and theyre the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that youve taken notice of them. besides, you know very well youve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. youll be missing your call again. a group of men  journalists  noticing the look of fury on saint-loups face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. and as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them. oh, but i know him; hes a friend of mine, cried saint-loups mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. look how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body! the dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child. oh, thats too lovely, the way he copies himself, she cried, clapping her hands. i implore you, my dearest girl, saint-loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, do not make a scene here, i cant stand it; i swear, if you say another word i wont go with you to your room, i shall walk straight out; come, dont be so naughty.    you oughtnt to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, itll make you ill, he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our balbec days. oh! what a good thing it would be if you did go. i warn you, if i do i shant come back. thats more than i should venture to hope. listen; you know, i promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this.     ah! well, that doesnt surprise me in the least. you gave me your promise; i ought to have known youd never keep it. you want the whole world to know youre made of money, but im not a money-grubber like you. you can keep your blasted necklace; i know some one else wholl give it to me. no one else can possibly give it to you; ive told boucheron hes to keep it for me, and i have his promise not to let anyone else have it. there you are, trying to blackmail me, youve arranged everything, i see. thats what they mean by marsantes, mater semita, it smells of the race, retorted rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for semita means path and not semite, but one which the nationalists applied to saint-loup on account of the dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. she was less entitled than anyone to apply the word jew to mme. de marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of judaism apart from her connexion with the lvy-mirepoix family. but this isnt the last of it, i can tell you. an agreement like that isnt binding. you have acted treacherously towards me. boucheron shall be told of it and hell be paid twice as much for his necklace. youll hear from me before long; dont you worry. robert was in the right a hundred times over. but circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. and i could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at balbec: in that way i keep a hold over her. you dont understand what i mean about the necklace. i made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, its only natural, surely, that i shouldnt give it to you; i fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. you cant seriously maintain that i brag about my money, im always telling you that im only a poor devil without a cent to my name. its foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. what possible interest can i have in hurting you? you know very well that my one interest in life is yourself. oh, yes, yes, please go on, she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. and turning to watch the dancer: isnt he too wonderful with his hands. a woman like me couldnt do the things hes doing now. she went closer to him and, pointing to roberts furious face: look, hes hurt, she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for saint-loup. listen, for the last time, i swear to you it doesnt matter what you do  in a week youll be giving anything to get me back  i shant come; its a clean cut, do you hear, its irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when its too late. perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances. but, my dear boy, he went on, to me, you oughtnt to stand about here, i tell you, it will make you cough. i pointed to the scenery which barred my way. he touched his hat and said to one of the journalists: would you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend. his mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and: do they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands? she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. you look just like one yourself, im sure i could have a wonderful time with you and a girl i know. theres no rule against smoking that i know of; if people arent well, they have only to stay at home, said the journalist. the dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress. oh! do stop! youll make me quite mad, she cried to him. then there will be trouble. in any case, sir, you are not very civil, observed saint-loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed. at that moment i saw saint-loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom i could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed  without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante  after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalists cheek. now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, i should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one anothers blood. but what i could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how saint-loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. as for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: good heavens, i believe the curtains going up; we shant get into our seats. i wanted to speak to saint-loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the play necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. the journalists friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. but, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. and so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speakers brother. indeed they seemed quite to resent their friends not having shared their several emotions. what, didnt it strike you? you must be going blind. what i say is that youre a pack of curs, growled the journalist whom saint-loup had punished. forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought  but they did not think of it  to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: whats all the excitement? keep your hair on, old chap. dont take the bit in your teeth. i had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which roberts love for rachel when from the lord was based; i was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. i had stopped for a moment at a corner of the avenue gabriel from which i had often in the past seen gilberte appear. i tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a gymnastic pace to overtake saint-loup when i saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. i concluded that this was a personal friend of robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, i saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before saint-loups face and body, a flickering constellation. flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. they were merely, however, saint-loups pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this  to all appearance ideal and decorative  arrangement. but this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which saint-loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. he gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that saint-loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. saint-loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. the incident was in no way connected (as i had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. it was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that saint-loup was, had made overtures to him. my friend could not get over the audacity of this clique who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of paris. and yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. now, that saint-loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. and so, although saint-loups arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals. these incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in robert a desire to be left alone for a while. after a moments silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on mme. de villeparisis. he would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me. as i had supposed before making the acquaintance of mme. de villeparisis at balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of mme. de guermantes. mme. de villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. certainly i had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how mme. de villeparisis, at balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through spain which my father was then making with m. de norpois. even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy  of more than twenty years standing  between mme. de villeparisis and the ambassador could have been responsible for the ladys loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the marquise than just an old friend. had mme. de villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? that sharp tongue which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? all this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which  giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation  mme. de villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. that generation is reflected in them but is not continued. instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. and whether or not there had been in the life of mme. de villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation. it is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which mme. de villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word restraint is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; i had remarked at balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to mme. de villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. but this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves  on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces  true artistic qualities. now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. what artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. and yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the memoirs which she afterwards published, mme. de villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. but a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. in a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. and between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open mme. de villeparisiss memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old marquise on the staircases of the embassies by a snob like mme. leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors or solicitors wives whom she would find there. a bluestocking mme. de villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets. moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a complete woman. it is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for ones own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of ones social relations. i had seen at balbec mme. de villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. but i had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. she would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the faubourg saint-germain. to the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. certainly, if at a given moment in her youth mme. de villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. she had wished to shew the duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. but now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. she would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. how many womens lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. flung on the wind in what way? the young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable marquise de villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period mme. de villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. in the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. we are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. the disdainful bow of mme. leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of mme. de villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition. no doubt at the same moment at which mme. leroi was  to use an expression beloved of mme. swann cutting the marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how queen marie-amlie had once said to her: you are just like a daughter to me. but such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old conservatoire medalist. the only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. and for all that she could remember the queens using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which mme. leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day. it must be remarked, however, that in mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room the absence of mme. leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. they were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which mme. leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that mme. de villeparisiss receptions were, as the readers of her memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in paris. on the occasion of this first call which, after leaving saint-loup, i went to pay on mme. villeparisis, following the advice given by m. de norpois to my father, i found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. side by side with the guermantes and villeparisis portraits one saw those  gifts from the sitters themselves  of queen marie-amlie, the queen of the belgians, the prince de joinville and the empress of austria. mme. de villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a breton inn-keeper who, however parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florists counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. in this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when i arrived a librarian with whom mme. de villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the duchesse de montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. it was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. but, for one thing, the anti-dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. in the second place, mme. de villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the case and never gave it a thought. lastly, a young man like bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. he had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. the rumanians, the egyptians, the turks may hate the jews. but in a french drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaenas, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound salaams, completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. only it is essential that the jew should not be actually in society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of mascarilles nose than of solomons. but bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with england or spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his european costume, as one of decampss jews. marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at susa before the gates of the palace of darius. (later in the afternoon bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that m. de charlus inquired whether his first name was jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) but, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from jews, greeks, persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. we know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient greeks, we have seen assyrians on the walls of a palace at susa. and so we feel, on encountering in a paris drawing-room orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. we knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. the young greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a turkish lady or a jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. it is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which  up to the present, at any rate  the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient greeks, of the ancient hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. in the young greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. i felt that if i had in the light of mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room taken photographs of bloch, they would have furnished of israel the same image  so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity  which we find in spirit photographs. there is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the infinite utters only these words  the same that had just issued from the lips of bloch: take care of my top hat. oh, ministers, my dear sir, mme. de villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: nobody ever wanted to see them. i was only a child at the time, but i can remember so well the king begging my grandfather to invite m. decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the duchesse de berry. it will give me pleasure, florimond, said the king. my grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said m. de castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. when he understood that it was m. decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to m. decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. for we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it tea or dancing or music. but if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. m. decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. he had obeyed the king, but he had not had m. decazes at his ball.    yes, sir, i remember m. mole very well, he was a clever man  he shewed that in his reception of m. de vigny at the academy  but he was very pompous, and i can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand. ah! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry ones hat in ones hand in ones own house, observed bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: there, you see what shes like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, shes quite amazing. oh, dear, no, replied mme. de villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, it was a habit m. mole had; that was all. i never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the king came, because the king being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room. aristotle tells us in the second chapter of     ventured m. pierre, the historian of the fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other peoples lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. he sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by mr. wells. fortunately he had found mme. de villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait. meanwhile he was cut short by bloch. indeed, the latter remarked, referring to what mme. de villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. do you know, i never knew that, as though it were strange that he should not have known it always. talking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew basin played on me yesterday morning? mme. de villeparisis asked the librarian. he told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the queen of sweden who had called to see me. what! he made them tell you just like that! i say, he must have a nerve, exclaimed bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity. i was quite surprised, because i had only been back from the country a few days; i had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that i was in paris, and i asked myself how the queen of sweden could have heard so soon, went on mme. de villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the queen of sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess. earlier in the day mme. de villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom mme. de villeparisis was at home, and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as mme. leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the authors disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. in the opinion of mme. leroi, mme. de villeparisiss parties were third-rate; and mme. de villeparisis felt the sting of mme. lerois opinion. but hardly anyone to-day remembers who mme. leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, frequented as it was by the queen of sweden, and as it had been by the due daumale, the duc de broglie, thiers, montalembert, mgr. dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of homer and pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men. now of all this mme. de villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories  sometimes slightly touched up by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. and then there was m. de norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or french statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to mme. de villeparisis. possibly mme. leroi also knew these european celebrities. but, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the eastern question to her prime ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. love? she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: what are your views on love?love? i make it, constantly, but i never talk about it. when she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the duchesse de guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. they often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which mme. de villeparisis forced them to engage. but these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the memoirs of mme. de villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in corneilles tragedies. furthermore, the parties of the villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. and if the literary bent of the villeparisis is the cause of the lerois disdain, the disdain of the lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. god, whose will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the lerois, for he knows that if these should invite the villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight. presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of marie-antoinette. i did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in parisian society and who, like mme. de villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were ikjw lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. each of these ladies had her own duchesse de guermantes, the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the duchesse de guermantes of either of the others. mme. de villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. furthermore, the lady with the mark-antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on mme. de villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the duchesse de guermantes did not come to her fridays. her consolation was that at these same fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the princesse de poix, who was her own personal guermantes, and who never went near mme. de villeparisis, albeit mme. de poix was an intimate friend of the duchess. nevertheless from the mansion on the quai malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the rue de tournon, the rue de la chaise and the faubourg saint-honor, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom i would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one anothers society. besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. how should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a duc de sagan or a prince de ligne? especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. indeed these old ladies men about town nephews  and saint-loup the foremost of them  when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once i will take you to see my aunt villeparisis, (or whichever it was) you meet interesting people there. they knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when i objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. the misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that i was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. in a word, these three parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. i felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the greeks who created icarus, theseus, heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. but one does not tabulate the sum of a persons vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. in that gallery of symbolical figures which is society, the really light women, the true messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the pope regularly sends his golden rose, and who as often as not has written  on the early days of lamartine  an essay that has been crowned by the french academy. how dye do, alix? mme. de villeparisis greeted the marie-antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for mme. de villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. thus mme. de villeparisis took good care not to introduce bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the quai malaquais. besides it was only tit for tat. for, the evening before, the old lady had had mme. ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that mme. de villeparisis, from whom she had filched the italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. so that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. mme. de villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of bloch, made me known to the marie-antoinette of the quai malaquais. the latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades  and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances  just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if i had not existed. by this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring mme. de villeparisis: you see, im nowhere near him; please understand that im not interested  in any sense of the word, you old cat  in little boys. but when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name  she had been born a choiseul, moreover  had a prodigious effect on me. i understand, sir, that you are thinkin of writin somethin about mme. la duchesse de montmorency, said mme. de villeparisis to the historian of the fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: im goin to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the louvre. she rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the duchesse de montmorency, abbess of one of the most famous chapters in the east of france. everyone had risen. what is rather amusin, said our hostess, is that in these chapters where our great-aunts were so often made abbesses, the daughters of the king of france would not have been admitted. they were very close corporations. not admit the kings daughters, cried bloch in amazement, why ever not? why, because the house of france had not enough quartering after that low marriage. blochs bewilderment increased. a low marriage? the house of france? when was that? why, when they married into the medicis, replied mme. de villeparisis in the most natural manner. its a fine picture, aint it, and in a perfect state of preservation, she added. my dear, put in the marie-antoinette lady, surely you remember that when i brought liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy. i should bow to any opinion of liszt on music, but not on painthe besides, he was quite off his head then, and i dont remember his ever saying anything of the sort. but it wasnt you that brought him here. i had met him any number of times at dinner at princess sayn-wittgensteins. alixs shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. and, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park. ah, i see another fine portrait, began the historian. the door opened and the duchesse de guermantes entered the room. well, how are you? mme. de villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: that is the portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld.     a young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver. it is that gentleman who has been several times to see mme. la marquise. did you tell him i was at home? he heard the voices. oh, very well then, shew him in. its a man who was introduced to me, she explained. he told me he was very anxious to come to the house. i certainly never said he might. but here hes taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesnt do to hurt peoples feelings. sir, she went on to me, and you, sir, to the historian of the fronde, let me introduce my niece, the duchesse de guermantes. the historian made a low bow, as i did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of mme. de guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention. the importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for mme. de villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was legrandin. thank you so very much for letting me come and see you, he began, laying stress on the word very. it is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; i assure you that its repercussion     he stopped short on catching sight of me. i was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the maxims; its a family picture. mme. de guermantes meanwhile had greeted alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. i hear all about you from madeleine, she added. she was at luncheon with me to-day, said the marquise of the quai malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that mme. de villeparisis could never say that. meanwhile i had been talking to bloch, and fearing, from what i had been told of his fathers change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, i said to him that his must be the happier of the two. my remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. but such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. yes, i do lead a delightful existence, bloch assured me with a beatified smile. i have three great friends; i do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; i am infinitely happy. rare is the mortal to whom father zeus accords so much felicity. i fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. it was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: oh, it was nothing, really, and so forth, when, to my question: was it a good show? put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which i had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: why, yes, it was quite a good show, couldnt have been better. it was really charming! what you have just told us interests me enormously, said legrandin to mme. de villeparisis, for i was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which i will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. i should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but i shall remember them. they are, in a phrase which comes, i think, from joubert, friends of the memery. you have never read joubert? oh! he would have admired you so! i will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. he had not your strength. but he had a great deal of charm all the same. i would have gone up to legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that i might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to mme. de villeparisis. she shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian. and this is the famous marie de rohan, duchesse de chevreuse, who was married first of all to m. de luynes. my dear, speaking of mme. de luynes reminds me of yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if i had known that you werent engaged id have sent round to ask you to come. mme. ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by queen carmen sylva in the authors presence. it was too beautiful! what treachery! thought mme. de villeparisis. of course that was what she was whispering about the other day to mme. de beaulaincourt and mme. de chaponay. i had no engagement, she replied, but i should not have come. i heard ristori in her great days, shes a mere wreck now. besides i detest carmen sylvas poetry. ristori came here once, the duchess of aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the inferno, by dante. in that sort of thing shes incomparable. alix bore the blow without flinching. she remained marble. her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. but the surface of one cheek was scaling. a faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. perhaps another winter would level her with the dust. now, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of mme, de montmorency, mme. de villeparisis said to legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again. seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, mme. de guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt. its m. legrandin, murmured mme. de villeparisis, he has a sister called mme. de cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me. what! oh, but i know her quite well! exclaimed mme. de guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. that is to say, i dont know her, but for some reason or other basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. and she did. i cant tell you what it was like. she informed me that she had been to london, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the british museum. and this very day, the moment i leave your house, im going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. and dont for a moment suppose that its an easy thing to do. on the pretence that shes dying of some disease shes always at home, it doesnt matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, shes ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts. no, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity, mme. de guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. shes an impossible person, she talks about plumitives and things like that. what does plumitive mean? asked mme. de villeparisis. i havent the slightest idea! cried the duchess in mock indignation. i dont want to know. i dont speak that sort of language. and seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of mme. de cambremer: why, of course, she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, everybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. but its a dreadful word. its enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. nothing will ever make me use words like that. and so thats the brother, is it? i hadnt realized that yet. but after all its not inconceivable. she has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. shes just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. yes, im beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly. sit down, were just going to take a dish of tea, said mme. de villeparisis to her niece. help yourself; you dont want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as i do. presently mme. de villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. the rest of the party gathered round her, and i took the opportunity to go up to legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that i had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: well, sir, i am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when i find you here too. m. legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that i was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief. you might at least have the civility to begin by saying how dye do to me, he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which i had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. what happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. and suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. i knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the academy. but really legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this. naturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere, he went on in lower tones, although i am perfectly free to do what i choose, still i cant behave like an absolute boor. mme. de guermantes had sat down. her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. i felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks  which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name guermantes  was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. later on, when she had ceased to interest me, i came to know many of the duchesss peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which i already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in france, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at combray or the pastry-cooks in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. but on this first day i discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that i might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which i should have found some indication of the name guermantes. in any case, i told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title duchesse de guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that i thought i could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. perhaps i should have been not quite so deeply stirred had i met her at mme. de villeparisiss at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the marquises days, at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoons outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: mme. de guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round combray where i had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when mme. de guermantes drove through them, in the rue de la paix. with a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that mme. de guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust. that admirable writer g-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on mme. de villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. the duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. he was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, mme. de guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with royalties who were curious to meet him. for the duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctors orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. it was true that these eminent men used to see at the guermantes the princesse de parme, the princesse de sagan (whom franoise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, the sagante), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the due de guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. others more simple still thought that perhaps the duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. the better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the duchesss marvellous brain, assumed that she must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. and it was true that the duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. but the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. for she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. if, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with thiers, mrime and augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. moreover the type of mind illustrated by mrime and meilhac and halvy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. this abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. mme. de guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. the duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. they sat down to luncheon. do you like this way of doing eggs? she asked the poet. on hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from guermantes: give monsieur some more eggs, she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the duchess, the poet and he himself left paris. but the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided mme. de guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither duke nor duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. and presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. this reserve was simply a matter of good form. but for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without  whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness  the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. it must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the duchess, was by no means constant with her. mme. de guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. it had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from victor hugo or lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending. if, in the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, just as in the church at combray, on the day of mlle. percepieds wedding, i had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of mme. de guermantes the unknown element of her name, i at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. but in order that i should not be disappointed by the words which i should hear uttered by a person who called herself mme. de guermantes, even if i had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which i had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. of course i had already heard mme. de villeparisis, saint-loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. but this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which i myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: the duchesse de guermantes, as though it were a name that was just like other names. and then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. for when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that i knew that i imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like bergotte that i peopled this group. no, by intelligence i understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which i understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), mme. de guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life. i thought i should find basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day, said mme. de guermantes to her aunt. i havent set eyes on your husband for some days, replied mme. de villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. in fact, i havent seen him. well, i have seen him once, perhaps  since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the queen of sweden. mme. de guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil, we met her at dinner last night at blanche lerois. you wouldnt know her now, shes positively enormous; im sure she must have something the matter with her. i was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog, mme. de guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment. i dont remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now shes the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. or rather, it isnt quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, shes more like a frog in an interesting condition. ah, that is quite clever, said mme. de villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her nieces wit. it is purely arbitrary, though, answered mme. de guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as swann would have done, for i must admit i never saw a frog in the family way. anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for i never saw her so skittish as shes been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. i promised id let you know in good time. mme. de villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: i know she was dining with the mecklenburgs the night before last. hannibal de braut was there. he came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, i must say. there was a man there whos a great deal wittier than babal, said mme. de guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih m. de brut-consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. i mean m. bergotte. i had never imagined that bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, i thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which i had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the duchess smile, m. de braut was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the faubourg saint-germain. i was stupefied to see the balance upset, and bergotte rise above m. de braut. but above all i was dismayed to think that i had avoided bergotte on the evening of phdre, that i had not gone up and spoken to him, when i heard mme. de guermantes say to mme. de villeparisis: he is the only person i have any wish to know, went on the duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. it would be such a pleasure. the presence of bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which i had thought liable to give mme. de guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon. i gather that he didnt behave very well, he was presented to m. de cobourg, and never uttered a word to him, said mme. de guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. he never once said monseigneur to him, she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a protestant, during an audience with the pope, to go on his knees before his holiness. interested by these idiosyncrasies of bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. despite this unusual mode of appreciating bergottes originality, it was a fact which i was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that mme. de guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider bergotte more witty than m. de braut. thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. and they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards. the comte dargencourt, charg daffaires at the belgian legation and a remote connexion of mme. de villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the baron de guermantes and h. h. the due de chtellerault, whom mme. de guermantes greeted with: how dye do, young chtellerault, in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young dukes mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. the historian of the fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayors office and not knowing what to do with his hat. feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them: no, no, he said, dont leave them on the floor, theyll be trodden on. a glance from the baron de guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian. what is that persons name? i was asked by the baron, who had just been introduced to me by mme. de villeparisis. m. pierre, i whispered. pierre what? pierre: its his name, hes a historian, a most distinguished man. really? you dont say so. no, its a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor, mme. de villeparisis explained. im like you, i can never get used to it. still, its better than my nephew robert, who always leaves his in the hall. i tell him when i see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and i ask him if hes come to wind the clocks. you were speaking just now, madame la marquise, of m. moles hat; we shall soon be able, like aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats, said the historian of the fronde, somewhat reassured by mme. de villeparisiss intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him. she really is astonishing, the little duchess, said m. dargencourt, pointing to mme. de guermantes who was talking to g. whenever theres a famous man in the room youre sure to find him sitting with her. evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. it cant always be m. de borelli, of course, or m. schlumberger or m. davenel. but then its bound to be m. pierre loti or m. edmond rostand. yesterday evening at the doudeauvilles, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had m. deschanel on one side and the german ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about china; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldnt hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasnt going to be war. really, youd have said she was a queen, holding her circle. everyone had gathered round mme. de villeparisis to watch her painting. those flowers are a truly celestial pink, said legrandin, i should say sky-pink. for there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. but, he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the marquise, i think i shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. you leave pisanello and van huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals. an artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them. what makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we dont have now, but they did it with great skill. ah! the flowers of their period! that is a most ingenious theory, exclaimed legrandin. i see youre painting some fine cherry blossoms  or are they may-flowers? began the historian of the fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats. no; theyre apple blossom, said the duchesse de guermantes, addressing her aunt. ah! i see youre a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another. why yes, so they are! but i thought the season for apple blossom was over now, said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake. oh dear, no; far from it, its not out yet; the trees wont be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps, said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of mme. de villeparisiss estates, was better informed upon country matters. at least three weeks, put in the duchess; even round paris, where theyre very far forward. down in normandy, dont you know, at his fathers place, she went on, pointing to the young duc de chtellerault, where they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a japanese screen, theyre never really pink until after the twentieth of may. i never see them, said the young duke, because they give me hay fever. such a bore. hay fever? i never heard of that before, said the historian. its the fashionable complaint just now, the librarian informed him. that all depends, you wont get it at all, probably, if its a good year for apples. you know le normands saying: when its a good year for apples    , put in m. dargencourt who, not being really french, was always trying to give himself a parisian air. youre quite right, mme. de villeparisis told her niece, these are from the south. it was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. youre surprised, i dare say, monsieur valmre, she turned to the librarian, that a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. well, i may be an old woman, but im not quite on the shelf yet, i have still a few friends, she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, i could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles. bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which mme. de villeparisis was painting. never mind, marquise, said the historian, sitting down again, even though we should have another of those revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood  and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell, he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no disaffected person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, with a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right. the historian of the fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. but he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old mans. bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet. really, you have the fingers of a fairy, went on (to the marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed blochs clumsiness. but bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: its not of the slightest importance; im not wet. mme. de villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. she invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also mme. de guermantes, with the injunction: remember to tell gisle and berthe (the duchesses dauberjon and de portefin) to be here a little before two to help me, as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables. she treated her princely relatives, as she treated m. de norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, cottard, bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. this was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister  who needed and received tactful handling  of their father or uncle. there would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. but, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. she could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five oclock tea-parties as, later on, in her memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. and the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the cottards, of the blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for mme. de villeparisis  failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her  the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the duchesse de guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. bloch got up to go. he had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: if people cant train their servants to put flowers where they wont be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, its much better not to go in for such luxuries, he muttered angrily. he was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. in a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. he had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. fortunately in another minute mme. de villeparisis was to press him to stay. either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. he, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. but mme. de villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting m. de norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the marquises drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in europe thronged. he had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress with pure eyes, fair as hera, who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. but on hearing this ladys name mme. de villeparisis had declined, for it was that of saint-loups mistress. i have better news, she murmured in my ear. i really believe hes quite cooled off now, and that before very long theyll be parted  in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business, she added. for roberts family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on m. de borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdressers instance, to go to bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. its really too bad of him, said mme. de villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the guermantes, even the most depraved. too, too bad, she repeated, giving the word a trio of ts. one felt that she had no doubt of the princes being present at all their orgies. but, as kindness of heart was the old ladys dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: the prince de borodino! speaking as a woman for whom the empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us. i have a great admiration for de saint-loup-en-bray, said bloch, dirty dog as he is, because hes so extremely well-bred. i have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, theyre so rare, he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. i will give you an example which i consider most striking of his perfect breeding. i met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. he introduced us, but i did not catch the gentlemans name; one never does catch peoples names when ones introduced to them, he explained with a laugh, this being one of his fathers witticisms. de saint-loup-en-bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. well, i found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of sir rufus israels! the end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. the fact was that sir rufus israels, who seemed to bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom saint-loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it. i learned this, bloch informed us, from the person who holds sir rufuss power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. oh, an absolutely wonderful individual, he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself. tell me, bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, how much do you suppose saint-loup has? not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, dont you. im interested from the balzacian point of view. you dont happen to know what its in, french stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what? i could give him no information whatsoever. suddenly raising his voice, bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. mme. de villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. of course, if its bad for you! bloch was downcast. but you cant say its not hot in here. and breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against mme. de villeparisis. he received none, from these well-bred people. his blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: whats the temperature? seventy-two, at least, i should say. im not surprised. im simply dripping. and i have not, like the sage antenor, son of the river aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils. and with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: well, if you believe its good for you! i must say, i think youre quite wrong. its exactly what gives you your cold. bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting m. de norpois. he would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the dreyfus case. theres a mentality at work there which i dont altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat, he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the ambassador. mme. de villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. she was more shocked to hear bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: havent i read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the japanese war was bound to end in a russian victory and a japanese defeat? hes fairly paralytic now, isnt he? im sure hes the old boy ive seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels. oh, dear, no! not in the least like that! just wait a minute, the marquise went on, i dont know what he can be doing. she rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: go and tell m. de norpois to come in she ordered him, he is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and ive been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. he will tell you about the dreyfus case, anything you want to know, she said gruffly to bloch. he doesnt approve much of the way things are going. for m. de norpois was not on good terms with the government of the day, and mme. de villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask m. de norpois to introduce them to mme. de villeparisis. but several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. one knew the address. one went to the house. one did not see its mistress. but at dinner that evening she would say: i hear theyve been down here bothering you. i trust things are going better. you are not in a hurry? she now asked bloch. no, not at all. i wanted to go because i am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at vichy for my biliary ducts, he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony. why, thats where my nephew chtelleraults got to go, you must fix it up together. is he still in the room? hes a nice boy, you know, said mme. de villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other. oh, i dare say he wouldnt care about that  i dont really know him  at least i barely know him. he is sitting over there, stammered bloch in ecstasy of confusion. the butler could not have delivered his mistresss message properly, for m. de norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss mme. de villeparisiss hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. he was not aware that the marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking m. de norpois and bloch into an adjoining room. bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be m. de norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: who is that old idiot? perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by m. de norpois had really shocked the better element in blochs nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. however that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed. monsieur lambassadeur, said mme. de villeparisis, i should like you to know this gentleman. monsieur bloch, monsieur le marquis de norpois. she made a point, despite her casual usage of m. de norpois, of addressing him always as monsieur lambassadeur, as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his ambassadorial rank, a respect which the marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man  which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover. m. de norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name bloch, and murmured: i am delighted     whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: not at all! on the contrary, it is i who am delighted. but this ceremony, which m. de norpois, in his friendship for mme. de villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of bloch, to whom she said: just ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if its more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. i think you wished to speak to him about the dreyfus case, she went on, no more considering whether this would suit m. de norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the duchesse de montmorencys portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup. you must speak loud, she warned bloch, hes a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew bismarck very well, and cavour. that is so, isnt it; she raised her voice, you knew bismarck well? have you got anything on the stocks? m. de norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. i took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for i saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. you shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. i gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. are you thinking of letting us have anything else? you were greatly smitten with bergotte, if i remember rightly. youre not to say anything against bergotte, put in the duchess. i dont dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, duchess. he understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like m. cherbuliez. but it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelists business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. i shall be seeing your father on sunday at our good friend a. j.s, he went on, turning again to myself. i had hoped for a moment, when i saw him talking to mme. de guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to mme. swanns. another of my great favourites, i told him, is elstir. it seems the duchesse de guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable bunch of radishes which i remember at the exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is! and indeed, if i had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture i liked best, i should have named this bunch of radishes. a masterpiece? cried m. de norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. it makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch. (he was right.) if you label a clever little thing of that sort masterpiece, what have you got to say about hberts virgin or dagnan-bouveret? i heard you refusing to let him bring roberts woman, said mme. de guermantes to her aunt, after bloch had taken the ambassador aside. i dont think youll miss much, shes a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides shes grotesquely ugly. do you mean to say, you know her, duchess? asked m. dargencourt. yes, didnt you know that she performed in my house before the whole of paris, not that thats anything for me to be proud of, explained mme. de guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. hallo, i suppose i ought to be going now, she added, without moving. she had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze  dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun  of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the bulls which the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies skirts and interrupting conversations. a permanent smile  suggesting a good king of yvetot slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a sharks fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: how do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, monsieur bloch; how do, argencourt; and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: how do, my young neighbour, hows your father? what a splendid fellow he is! he made no great demonstration except to mme. de villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron. being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latters self-sufficiency. one could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a greek gods. do you mean to tell me she performed in your house? m. dargencourt asked the duchess. well, dont you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress. mme. de guermantes shared her aunts affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her rs like mme. de villeparisis. before m. de norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, i went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my fathers academic chair. he tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. i pointed out that i was going to balbec. what? going again to balbec? why, youre a regular globe-trotter. he listened to what i had to say. at the name of leroy-beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. i conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to m. leroy-beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economists having repeated it to him. all at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. and after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: no, no, he said to me with emotion, your father must not stand. in his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. he is too big a man for that. if he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. he is not an orator, thank heaven. and that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of academe. besides, he would not get many votes. the academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. for the present, there is nothing to be done. later on, i dont say. but he must wait until the society itself comes in quest of him. it makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far da s of our friends across the alps. leroy-beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way i did not at all like. i pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as bismarck used to say. but, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, principis obsta. his friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. indeed, he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, i am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. well, simply because i am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables arcades ambo), simply because i know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, i should not vote for him. i fancy, moreover, that i have given him to understand that i should not. (i seemed to discern in his eyes the stern assyrian profile of leroy-beaulieu.) so that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part. m. de norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther academicians as old fossils. other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: ah! if it only rested with me! than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. i may tell you, he concluded, that in the best interests of you all, i should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years time. words which i assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on i was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning. you havent thought of giving the institute an address on the price of bread during the fronde, i suppose, the historian of that movement timidly inquired of m. de norpois. you could make a considerable success of a subject like that, (which was to say, you would give me a colossal advertisement,) he added, smiling at the ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. i seemed to have seen this look before, and yet i had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. suddenly i remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which i suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. when, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, i had told him that i knew professor cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in cotterds interest: now this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the academy of medicine! he had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the fronde. obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. and the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. i did not hear the ambassadors reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round mme. de villeparisis to watch her at work. you know who were talking about, basin? the duchess asked her husband. i can make a pretty good guess, said the duke. ah! as an actress shes not, im afraid, in what one would call the great tradition. you cant imagine, went on mme. de guermantes to m. dargencourt anything more ridiculous. in fact, it was drolatic, put in m. de guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile. what i fail to understand, resumed the duchess, is how in the world robert ever came to fall in love with her. oh, of course i know one mustnt discuss that sort of thing, she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. i know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. and, she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, that is the really nice thing about love, because its what makes it so mysterious. mysterious! oh, i must confess, cousin, thats a bit beyond me, said the comte dargencourt. oh dear, yes, its a very mysterious thing, love, declared the duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the club that there is something more than just noise in the walkre. after all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think, she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. after all, one never knows anything, does one? she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. besides, one understands, doesnt one; one simply cant explain other peoples choices in love. but having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise saint-loups choice. all the same, dont you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person whos simply silly. bloch, hearing saint-loups name mentioned and gathering that he was in paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. he was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented la boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. he went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his la poulie friends. in the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. in this way bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. what harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the right thing, a la boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a saint, such as bloch himself? i say, though, what about swann? objected m. dargencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousins speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction. oh, but swanns case was quite different, the duchess protested. it was a great surprise, i admit, because shes just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking. oh, oh! muttered mme. de villeparisis. you never thought so? surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. nowadays, i quite agree, shes horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. not that that made me any less sorry when charles married her, because it was so unnecessary. the duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as m. dargencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words  either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh  and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. she went on: yes, really, it wasnt worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and i can quite understand anybodys falling in love with her, but if you saw roberts girl, i assure you, youd simply die of laughter. oh, i know somebodys going to quote augier at me: what matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk? well, robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasnt shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! first of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. oh, a mere nothing  what?  and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. and then, if youd heard the things she recited, i only remember one scene, but im sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the seven princesses. seven princesses! dear, dear, what a snob she must be! cried m. dargencourt. but, wait a minute, why, i know the whole play. the author sent a copy to the king, who couldnt understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him. it isnt by any chance, from the sar peladan? asked the historian of the fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed. so you know the seven princesses, do you? replied the duchess, i congratulate you! i only know one, but shes quite enough; i have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. if they are all like the one ive seen! what a goose! i thought to myself. irritated by the coldness of her greeting, i found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand maeterlinck. to think thats the woman i walk miles every morning to see. really, im too kind. well, its my turn now not to want to see her. thus i reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger. i cant tell you what it was like, the duchess went on; you simply couldnt help laughing. not that anyone tried; rather the other way, im sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and robert has never really forgiven me. though i cant say im sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and i dont quite see marie-aynard approving of that. this was the name given in the family to roberts mother, mme. de marsantes, the widow of aynard de saint-loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the princesse de guermantes-bavire, also a marie, to whose christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her marie-gilbert or marie-hedwige. to begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair! went on mme. de guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. just imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didnt open her mouth  im not exaggerating  for a good five minutes. oh, i say, cried m. dargencourt. with the utmost politeness i took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. and she said  i give you her actual words one ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself. when you think of it, that really is monumental. but i understood she wasnt at all bad at reciting poetry, said one of the two young men. she hasnt the ghost of a notion what poetry is, replied mme. de guermantes. however, i didnt need to listen to her to tell that. it was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. i knew at once that she couldnt have any talent when i saw those lilies! everybody laughed. i hope, my dear aunt, you arent angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the queen of sweden. ive come to ask your forgiveness. oh, no, im not at all angry, i even give you leave to eat at my table, if youre hungry.  come along, m. valmre, youre the daughter of the house, mme. de villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry. m de guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him. this gentleman makes you an admirable daughter, commented m. dargencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep mme. de villeparisiss little joke in circulation. the librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the fronde. you perform your functions admirably, said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. at the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him. tell me, my dear aunt, m. de guermantes inquired of mme. de villeparisis, who was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as i came in? i must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but i couldnt place him at all; you know i never can remember names, its such a nuisance, he added, in a tone of satisfaction. m. legrandin. oh, but oriane has a cousin whose mother, if im not mistaken, was a grandin. yes, i remember quite well, she was a grandin de lepervier. no, replied mme. de villeparisis, no relation at all. these are plain grandins. grandins of nothing at all. but theyd be only too glad to be grandins of anything you chose to name. this one has a sister called mme. de cambremer. why, basin, you know quite well who my aunt means, cried the duchess indignantly. hes the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. she stayed a solid hour; i thought i should go mad. but i began by thinking it was she who was mad when i saw a person i didnt know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow. listen, oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; i couldnt very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, shes not in the least like a cow, he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience. he knew that his wifes lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process mme. de guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. and the duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player. i admit she doesnt look like a cow, she looks like a dozen, exclaimed mme. de guermantes. i assure you, i didnt know what to do when i saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how i was. i had half a mind to say: please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you cant possibly know me, because youre a herd of cattle, but after racking my brains over her i came to the conclusion that your cambremer woman must be the infanta dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that i was just on the point of saying: your royal highness and using the third person to a herd of cattle. the cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the queen of sweden. but this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. for i dont know how long before, i was bombarded with her cards; i used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. i couldnt think what they were supposed to be advertising. you saw nothing in the house but marquis et marquise de cambremer with some address or other which ive forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there. but its a great distinction to look like a queen, said the historian of the fronde. gad, sir, kings and queens, in these days, dont amount to much, said m. de guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly. bloch and m. de norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us. well, sir, asked mme. de villeparisis, have you been talking to him about the dreyfus case? m. de norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his dulcinea compelled him to submit. nevertheless he spoke to bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which france was passing. as this presumably meant that m. de norpois (to whom bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of dreyfus) was an ardent anti-dreyfusard, the ambassadors geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the government, flattered blochs vanity and aroused his curiosity. what were the important points which m. de norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and m. de norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, mme. de villeparisis having spoken at some length to m. de norpois of blochs literary work. you are not of your age, the former ambassador told him, and i congratulate you upon that. you are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a government. bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. but here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which m. de norpois referred. bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. he returned to the dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating m. de norpoiss own views. he tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. bloch had been able, thanks to a nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the zola trial. he would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the days proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. the human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. to blochs questions m. de norpois replied: there are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom i remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment i felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly  i mean m. de miribel. they are lieutenant-colonel henry and lieutenant-colonel picquart. but, exclaimed bloch, the divine athena, daughter of zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. and they are fighting against one another like two lions. colonel picquart had a splendid position in the army, but his moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. the sword of the nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men. m. de norpois made no reply. what are those two palavering about over there? m. de guermantes asked mme. de villeparisis, indicating m. de norpois and bloch. the dreyfus case. the devil they are. by the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of dreyfus? i give you a thousand guesses. my nephew robert! i can tell you that, at the jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. and as hes coming up for election next week     of course, broke in the duchess, if theyre all like gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the jews ought to be sent back to jerusalem. indeed; then the prince de guermantes is quite of my way of thinking, put in m. dargencourt. the duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable. what makes you think we want to hear about gilbert and jerusalem? its nothing to do with that. but, he went on in a gentler tone, you will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the jockey, especially robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. what can you expect, my dear, its got em on the raw, those fellows; theyre all over it. i dont blame them, either; personally, you know that i have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and i do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of marquis de saint-loup one isnt a dreyfusard; what more can i say? m. de guermantes uttered the words: when one goes by the name of marquis de saint-loup, with some emphasis. he knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of duc de guermantes. but if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title duc de guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. for the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. and not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. under this law m. de guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: when one goes by the name of duc de guermantes, whereas an educated man, a swann, a legrandin would not have said it. a duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet aristocratic be earned by the writings of a plebeian. who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom m. de guermantes had picked up when one goes by the name, he had probably not the least idea. but another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into france a certain weed from america, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. so, just as in a certain year i heard bloch say, referring to himself, that the most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without  namely bloch, and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so i was often to hear this when one goes by the name. what can one expect, the duke went on, with the influence hes come under; its easy to understand. still it is rather comic, suggested the duchess, when you think of his mothers attitude, how she bores us to tears with her patrie franaise, morning, noon and night. yes, but theres not only his mother to be thought of, you cant humbug us like that. theres a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of master dreyfus. she has passed on her state of mind to robert. you may not have heard, duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind, said the librarian, who was secretary to the anti-revisionist committee. they say mentality. it means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what youre talking about. it is the very latest expression just now, the last word as people say. meanwhile, having heard blochs name, he was watching him question m. de norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the marquise. trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a jew more or less affiliated to the syndicate. indeed, said the duke, mentality, you say; i must make a note of that; i shall use it some day. this was no figure of speech, the duke having a little pocketbook filled with such references which he used to consult before dinner-parties. i like mentality. there are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. i read somewhere the other day that some writer was talentuous. you may perhaps know what it means; i dont. and since then ive never come across the word again. but mentality is more widely used than talentuous, the historian of the fronde made his way into the conversation. i am on a committee at the ministry of education at which i have heard it used several times, as well as at my club, the volney, and indeed at dinner at m. emile olliviers. i, who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education, replied the duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, i who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education, he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, nor to the volney club (my only clubs are the union and the jockey  you arent in the jockey, i think, sir? he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), i, who am not even invited to dine with m. emile ollivier, i must confess that i had never heard mentality. im sure youre in the same boat, argencourt. you know, he went on, why they cant produce the proofs of dreyfuss guilt. apparently its because the war ministers wife was his mistress, thats what people are saying. ah! i thought it was the prime ministers wife, said m. dargencourt. i think youre all equally tiresome about this wretched case, said the duchesse de guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. it cant make any difference to me, so far as the jews are concerned, for the simple reason that i dont know any of them, and i intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. but on the other hand i do think it perfectly intolerable that just because theyre supposed to hold sound views and dont deal with jewish tradesmen, or have down with the jews printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of durands and dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by marie-aynard or victurnienne. i went to see marie-aynard a couple of days ago. it used to be so nice there. nowadays one finds all the people one has spent ones life trying to avoid, on the pretext that theyre against dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be. no; it was the war ministers wife; at least, thats the bedside rumour, went on the duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. personally, of course, as everyone knows, i take just the opposite view to my cousin gilbert. i am not feudal like him. i would go about with a negro if he was a friend of mine, and i shouldnt care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of saint-loup one doesnt amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than voltaire or even my nephew. nor does one go in for what i may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. it is a bit stiff, really! no, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. i expect she told him that he would be classed among the intellectuals. the intellectuals, theyre the very cream of those gentry. its given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one. and the duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wifes and m. dargencourts benefit, mater semita, which had already made its way into the jockey club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke. we might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us, he went on, indicating the historian. but it is better not to repeat it, especially as theres not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. i am not so ambitious as my cousin mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before christ to the tribe of levi, and i will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of jewish blood in our family. still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephews highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at landerneau. especially as fezensac is ill just now, and duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances, concluded the duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed making nuisances to mean making difficulties. bloch tried to pin m. de norpois down on colonel picquart. there can be no two opinions; replied m. de norpois, his evidence had to be taken. i am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, i have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the government were bound to let the colonel speak. one cant dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does theres always the risk of falling into a ditch. as for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. when one saw him, looking so well in that smart chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: on my honour as a soldier (here m. de norpoiss voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) such is my conviction, it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound. there; he is a dreyfusard, theres not the least doubt of it, thought bloch. but where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, gribelin. when one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make, (here m. de norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) when one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: colonel, sir, you know very well that i have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, i am speaking the truth, the wind changed; m. picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco. no; evidently hes an anti-dreyfusard; its quite obvious, said bloch to himself. but if he considers picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. and if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with gribelin? in any case, if this man dreyfus is innocent, the duchess broke in, he hasnt done much to prove it. what idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. i dont know whether m. esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. that cant be very pleasant for the supporters of m. dreyfus. what a pity for them theres no way of exchanging innocents. everybody laughed. you heard what oriane said? the duc de guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de villeparisis. yes; i think it most amusing. this was not enough for the duke. well, i dont know, i cant say that i thought it amusing; or rather it doesnt make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. i dont care about wit. m. dargencourt protested. it is probably because ive been a member of parliament, where i have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. i learned there to value, more than anything, logic. thats probably why they didnt elect me again. amusing things leave me cold. basin, dont play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do. please let me finish. it is just because i am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that i am often struck by my wifes wit. for you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. she reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer. possibly the explanation of m. de norpoiss speaking in this way to bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-dreyfusard that, finding the government not anti-dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the dreyfusards. perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. but where bloch made a mistake was in thinking that m. de norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by henry, picquart or du paty de clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. the truth, indeed, as to all these matters bloch could not doubt that m. de norpois knew. how could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the ministers? naturally, bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the president of the republic and the prime minister, who imparted it to their cabinet. now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patients disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctors reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. so, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as henrys confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the dreyfusard ministers, and by cavaignac and cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the dreyfusard ministers themselves, men of the same shade of dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du paty de clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter reinach. all that bloch could elicit from m. de norpois was that if it were true that the chief of staff, m. de boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to m. rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred. you may be quite sure that the war minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his chief of staff to the infernal powers. an official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. but the war minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. there are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards. but those documents are obviously forged, put in bloch. m. de norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by prince henri dorlans. besides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. heaven be praised, france is not a south american republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento. bioch could not get him to speak on the question of dreyfuss guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. on the other hand, m. de norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment. if it is a conviction, he said, it will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. to return to prince henris outburst, i greatly doubt whether it has met with his fathers approval. you think chartres is for dreyfus? asked the duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised. not at all; i meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable princesse clmentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, prince ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. you would never have found the prince of bulgaria clasping major esterhazy to his bosom. he would have preferred a private soldier, murmured mme. de guermantes, who often met the bulgarian monarch at dinner at the prince de joinvilles, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: yes, sir, of your bracelets. you arent going to mme. de sagans ball this evening? m. de norpois asked mme. de villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with bloch. my friend had not failed to interest the ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in blochs speech of the neo-homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: he is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. you expect him to come out with the learned sisters, like lamartine or jean-baptiste rousseau. it has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. we ourselves were inclined to be romantic. but however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, m. de norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough. no, sir, i dont go to balls any more, she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. youre going, all of you, i suppose? youre the right age for that sort of thing, she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance m. de chtellerault, his friend and bloch. still, i was asked, she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. in fact, they came specially to ask me. (they being the princesse de sagan.) i havent had a card, said bloch, thinking that mme. de villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that mme. de sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite. the marquise made no reply, and bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the rue royale club, which was letting in every tom, dick and harry, he wished to ask mme. de villeparisis to arrange for his election there. arent they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these sagans? he inquired in a tone of sarcasm. not at all, theyre the best we can do for you in that line, m. dargencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of parisian society, assured him. then, said bloch, still half in irony, i suppose its one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season. mme. de villeparisis turned merrily to mme. de guermantes. tell us, is it a great social solemnity, mme. de sagans ball? its no good asking me, answered the duchess, i have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. besides, society isnt my strong point. indeed; i thought it was just the other way, said bloch, who supposed mme. de guermantes to be speaking seriously. he continued, to the desperation of m. de norpois, to ply him with questions about the dreyfus case. the ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du paty de clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry. i know that the socialist party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the devils isle. but i think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the caudine forks of mm. grault-richard and company. so far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, i dont say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. that certain of your clients more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions i will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things, he added, with a look of great subtlety. it is essential that the government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the army. it stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. and what follows from that? obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. when the day comes, the government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. we must appoint judges to try dreyfus. and that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet france, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words truth and justice, it is necessary to cross the channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the spree, there are judges to be found outside berlin. but once the machinery of government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? when it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? when its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: present!? m. de norpois put these questions to bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. should you fail to disarm, m. de norpois went on, without waiting for blochs collective answer, should you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, i say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? have you given them pledges? bloch was in doubt how to answer. m. de norpois gave him no time. if the negative be true, as i should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the criminal court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. i do not guarantee that the whole of the general staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire. it stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list  already too long  of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece, he added, looking bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemys camp. government action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. the government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of colonel driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under m. clemenceaus. we must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. france, the vast majority here in france, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. as to that, there can be no question whatever. but we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. and the government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, i mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. the government will accept all your suggestions. if it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom. you, sir, said bloch, turning to m. dargencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentlemans arrival, you are a dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad. it is a question that concerns only the french themselves, dont you think? replied m. dargencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite. bloch coloured; m. dargencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at blochs expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. mme. de guermantes murmured something to m. dargencourt which i could not hear, but which must have referred to blochs religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the duchess that expression to which ones fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. to retrieve himself, bloch turned to the duc de chtellerault. you, sir, as a frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. anyhow, i know  can talk freely to you; saint-loup told me so. but the young duke, who felt that every one was turning against bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from m. de charlus, replied: you must not ask me, sir, to discuss the dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, i never mention except to japhetics. everyone smiled, except bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near sinai. but instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to blochs lips something quite different. and we caught only: but how on earth did you know? who told you? as though he had been the son of a convict. whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind. what m. de norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether mme. de villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house m. du paty de clam or m. joseph reinach. the librarian made no reply; he was a nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. he asked himself whether bloch might not be a secret emissary of the syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to mme. de villeparisis the questions that bloch had put to him. she decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise m. de norpois. also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her m. judets article in the petit journal). she decided, therefore, to make it plain to bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. as bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. blochs farewell, barely pencilling on the marquises face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. this scene left bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. mme. de villeparisis was startled. but doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes. i believe shes asleep, said bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the marquise, assumed an indignant air. good-bye madame, snouted bloch. the old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to m. dargencourt, while bloch left the room, convinced that she must be soft in the head. full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. she received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth. you were speaking just now of the seven princesses, duchess; you know (not that its anything to be proud of) that the author of that  what shall i call it?  that production is a compatriot of mine, said m. dargencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. yes, hes a belgian, by nationality, he went on. indeed! no, we dont accuse you of any responsibility for the seven princesses. fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. i know several charming belgians, yourself, your king, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, i am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the seven princesses. besides, if you want to know, its not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. you know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. if there was anything behind it all, i may tell you that im not in the least afraid of a little daring, she added in a serious tone, provided that there is some idea in it. i dont know if youve seen borellis piece. some people seem to have been shocked by it, but i must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it, she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, i found it immensely interesting. but theseven princesses! its all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, i cannot carry family feeling quite     the duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the comtesse de marsantes, roberts mother. mme. de marsantes was regarded in the faubourg saint-germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. so i had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the duc de guermantes. later, i have always been taken aback, whenever i have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de guermantes and mme. de marsantes, ought (i felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard. mme. de marsantes attended brunetires lectures. she fascinated the faubourg saint-germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. but the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify mme. de marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the duke. i could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyones sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. it seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and i was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. mme. de marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. this was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, m. de montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. she was a great lady. atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. mme. de marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. she was more than pleasant to me, both because i was roberts friend and because i did not move in the same world as he. this pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. a good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. mme. de marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance bergotte or elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the guermantes: i have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting monsieur bergotte, or of making the acquaintance of monsieur elstir whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that mme. de guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently honoured. whichever of these was the true reason, one felt that when mme. de marsantes said: i have had the honour, the great hon-our, she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. on the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity. in the country, mme. de marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of france had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call manners, and had given her a perfect simplicity. she never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. she was, people said, the perfect christian. she was determined to find an immensely rich wife for robert. being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. it is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. some one said to me afterwards, when i had told him of my meeting her: you saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman. but true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. i said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression. listen, said mme. de villeparisis to the duchesse de guermantes, im expecting a woman at any moment whom you dont wish to know. i thought id better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. but you neednt be afraid, i shall never have her here again, only i was obliged to let her come to-day. its swanns wife. mme. swann, seeing the dimensions that the dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husbands racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoners innocence. when he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of mme. verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. mme. swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the womens leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. it may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the duchesse de guermantes, so close a friend of swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. but we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the duchess, who held that she was not bound to do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social free will, which was extremely arbitrary. thank you for telling me, said the duchess. it would indeed be most unpleasant. but as i know her by sight i shall be able to get away in time. i assure you, oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman, said mme. de marsantes. i have no doubt she is, but i feel no need to assure myself of it. have you been invited to lady israelss? mme. de villeparisis asked the duchess, to change the conversation. why, thank heaven, i dont know the woman, replied mme. de guermantes. you must ask marie-aynard. she knows her. i never could make out why. i did indeed know her at one time, said mme. de marsantes. i confess my faults. but i have decided not to know her any more. it seems shes one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. i shall never go near anyone of that race again. while we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to jews. and now we see what thanks we get from them. but ive no right to speak; i have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine, she went on, having caught some allusion by m. dargencourt to robert. but, talking of robert, havent you seen him? she asked mme. de villeparisis; being saturday, i thought hed be coming to paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit. as a matter of fact mme. de marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see mme. de villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her. robert here! but i have never had a single word from him; i dont think ive seen him since balbec. he is so busy; he has so much to do, pleaded mme. de marsantes. a faint smile made mme. de guermantess eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. whenever the duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, mme. de marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-laws behalf. the latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by roberts pranks. at this point the door opened again and robert himself entered the room. well, talk of the saint! said mme. de guermantes. mme. de marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. when she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on robert eyes big astonishment. what! youve come! how delightful! what a surprise! ah! talk of the saint!  i see, cried the belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter. delicious, aint it? came tartly from the duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself. good afternoon, robert, she said, i believe hes forgotten his aunt. they talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as saint-loup was leaving her to join his mother mme. de guermantes turned to me: good afternoon; how are you? was her greeting. she allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. thus she acted under the fire of saint-loups eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me: hes not very well just now, he gets rather tired; i think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for i cant help telling you that he admires you immensely. oh, but thats very nice of him, said mme. de guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if i had brought her her cloak. i am most flattered. look, i must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair, said saint-loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt. we were both silent. i see you sometimes in the morning, she said, as though she were telling me something that i did not know, and i for my part had never seen her. its so good for one, a walk. oriane, began mme. de marsantes in a low tone, you said you were going on to mme. de saint-ferrols; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, i shall stay at home now that ive got robert. and one other thing, but i hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars robert likes. corona, theyre called. ive none in the house. robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of mme. de saint-ferrol. who in the world is mme. de saint-ferrol? he inquired, in a sur  prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society. but, my dear boy, you know quite well, said his mother. shes vermandoiss sister. it was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much. what, shes vermandoiss sister, i had no idea of that. really, my family are amazing, he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously blochs intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, they know the most unheard-of people, people called saint-ferrol (emphasising the final consonant of each word) and names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. its prodigious. mme. de guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephews wit. a servant came in to say that the prince von faffenheim-munsterburg-weinigen had sent word to m. de norpois that he was waiting. bring him in, sir, said mme. de villeparisis to the old ambassador, who started in quest of the german minister. stop, sir; do you think i ought to shew him the miniature of the empress charlotte? why, im sure hell be delighted, said the ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate minister the favour that was in store for him. oh, i know hes very sound, said mme. de marsantes, and that is so rare among foreigners. but ive found out all about him. he is anti-semitism personified. the princes name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were  to borrow an expression from music  attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the heim of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the german eighteenth century. this name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little german watering-place to which as a child i had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which homer applies to his heroes. and so, scarcely had i heard the princes name spoken than, before i had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. and then, m. de guermantes, in explaining who the prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and i recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, i used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. and indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. thus beneath the visor of the prince of the holy roman empire and knight of franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-oclock sun, that i saw, at any rate before the prince, rheingraf and elector palatine had entered the room. for i speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient burg that cherished memories of luther and lewis the germanic, he employed in keeping five charron motor-cars, a house in paris and one in london, a box on mondays at the opera and another for the tuesdays at the franais. he did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. he had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a corresponding member of the academy of moral and political sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see mme. de villeparisis. if he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in berlin, had begged to be introduced to the marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. he knew that m. de norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. and so the prince, who had known him in russia when they were both there as ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. but in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the marquis russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. no doubt m. de norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and take the trouble to come so far out of his way, went himself to the princes residence, and when the teutonic knight had launched his: i should like immensely to be your colleague, replied in a tone of deep emotion: ah! i should be most happy! and no doubt a simpleton, a dr. cottard would have said to himself: well, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesnt offer to vote for me it is because it hasnt occurred to him. he lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that i have all the support i want, and that is why he doesnt offer me his; but i have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: very well, vote for me, will you? and he will be obliged to do it. but prince von faffenheim was no simpleton. he was what dr. cottard would have called a fine diplomat and he knew that m. de norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. the prince, in his embassies and as foreign minister, had conducted, on his countrys behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. he was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. and it was for this reason that he had arranged for m. de norpois to receive the cordon of saint andrew. but if he had had to report to his government the conversation which he had subsequently had with m. de norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: i realised that i had gone the wrong way to work. for as soon as he had returned to the subject of the institute, m. de norpois had repeated: i should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. they ought, i consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. it is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. as you know, the academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. personally, i deplore this. how often have i had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! i cannot be sure, god forgive me, that i did not even once let the word hidebound escape me, he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. you understand, prince, that i should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. so long as my colleagues ideas linger so far behind the times, i consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. but you may rest assured that if i were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if i could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, i should be the first to inform you of it. the cordon was a mistake, thought the prince; the negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. i have not yet laid my hand on the right key. this was a kind of reasoning of which m. de norpois, formed in the same school as the prince, would also have been capable. one may mock at the pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. but their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that european or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. with this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood m. de norpois and prince von faffenheim had frequently had to deal. charg daffaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, m. de norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word peace, nor by the word war that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of france, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: war. moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the thtre du gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word war or the word peace was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a kurgarten where the minister and m. de norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. by a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. and so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the institute, the prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols. and certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. for one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. often one has to come down to kept persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. what man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: dont lets talk about money, the speech must be regarded as what is called in music a silent beat and that if, later on, she declares: you are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; ive done with you, he must interpret this as: some one else has been offering me more. and yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. the apache furnishes more striking examples. but m. as norpois and the german prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word perish. but inasmuch as all this is not set forth in yellow and otherwise coloured books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his norpois. the following winter the prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected. the devil! he said to himself, i cant afford to lose any time over the institute. if i wait too long, i may be dead before they elect me. that really would be unpleasant. he composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the revue des deux mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to m. de norpois. the french diplomat called upon him to thank him. he added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. the prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: still not the right one! and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed m. de norpois to the door, thought: damn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. we must hurry up. that evening, he met m. de norpois again at the opera. my dear ambassador, he began to him, you told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but i am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word. m. de norpois had no less high an esteem for the princes tact than the prince had for his. he understood at once that it was not a request that prince von faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it. well now, you will think me highly indiscreet. there are two people to whom i am greatly attached  in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment  two people both of whom have recently settled in paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the grand duchess john. they are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the king and queen of england, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. i confess that i did not know how i was going to gratify their wish when i learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. i know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people happy few, as stendhal would say  but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, i am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the grand duchess and the princess. perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the queen of england comes, and then (one never knows) if we dont bore her too much, to spend the easter holidays with us at beaulieu, at the grand duchess johns. the person i allude to is called the marquise de villeparisis. i confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the institute. for in her house, too, i understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk. with an inexpressible sense of pleasure the prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning. such an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear prince, replied m. de norpois; nothing is more in harmony with the institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of academicians. i shall convey your request to mme. la marquise de villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. as for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. but i shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. you must on no account give up the academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, i shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at leroy-beaulieus, without whom nobody can be elected; i had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. he raised certain objections. but it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and i fully intend to return to the charge; i shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, i shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, i should ask all my friends to vote for you, (here the prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) and he knows that i have friends. i consider that if i were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. come that evening, at six, to mme. de villeparisiss; i will introduce you to her and i can give you an account then of my conversation with him. thus it was that prince von faffenheim had been led to call upon mme. de villeparisis. my profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. it had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of minerva, leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from marivaux or samuel bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. in the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which i had expected, before i saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of mme. de villeparisis, the rheingraf said to her: aow to you too, matame la marquise, in the accent of an alsatian porter. wont you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good? mme. de guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. i do the honours in this house just as if it was mine, she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh. sir, said mme. de villeparisis to m. de norpois, you wont forget that you have something to say to the prince about the academy? mme. de guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time. gracious! i must fly at once if im to get to mme. de saint-ferrols, and im dining with mme. leroi. and she rose without bidding me good-bye. she had just caught sight of mme. swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. she remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of dreyfuss innocence. i dont want my mother to introduce me to mme. swann, saint-loup said to me. shes an ex-whore. her husbands a jew, and she comes here to pose as a nationalist. hallo, heres uncle palamde. the arrival of mme. swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which i am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. well, a few days before this visit to mme. de villeparisis, i had myself received a visitor whom i little expected, namely charles morel, the son (though i had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncles old servant. this great-uncle (he in whose house i had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. his servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; i had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for i had learned from franoise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncles memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. but, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. i was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentlemans servant. he made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the conservatoire. the object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. these were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. while young morel was shewing them to me, i noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. he derived from saying you to me as often, and sir as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: to my best friend. one actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: to the best of friends, which enabled her (so i was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. in vain might young morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. while i was turning over the photographs charles morel examined my room. and as i was looking for some place in which i might keep them, how is it, he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), that i dont see a single photograph of your uncle in your room? i felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: why, i dont believe i have such a thing. what, you havent one photograph of your uncle adolphe, who was so devoted to you! i will send you one of my governors  he has quantities of them  and i hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle. it is true that, as i had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle adolphe. but it was easy enough to see that for old morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. i was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that i was going to turn out a sort of racine, or vaulabelle, and morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. i soon discovered that this young man was extremely pushing. thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether i knew any poet who had a good position in society. i mentioned one. he did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. well, i found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the comtesse so-and-sos. this was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. the poet, taking offence, made no reply. for the rest, charles morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. he had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, jupiens niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, i felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. he had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, but not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, i rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople. albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,dear friend, i might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as not dear master, of course,.. although    well, if you like, dear distinguished artist, once in the shop, i avoided qualifying him, as saint-simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his you. he picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. the girl settled down to work again with her two apprentices, but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that charles morel, whom she regarded as of her own station (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. as i had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of miss sacripant (otherwise odette) by elstir, i said to charles morel as i went with him to the outer gate: i dont suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? i dont see at what stage in his life i can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of m. swann     why, if i wasnt forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that ladys picture. as a matter of fact, she was lunching with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. my father was in two minds whether to let you in. it seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. but just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again. he broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at jupiens niece. she was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. i, as i gave him my hand, was thinking of mme. swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that i should have henceforth to identify her with the lady in pink. m. de charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of mme. swann. at every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the barons frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. this partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for m. de charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. for instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. and then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, m. de charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. certainly mme. swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. but he professed admiration for her, friendship for swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room. mme. de villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from m. de charlus. he, while admitting serious defects in his aunts character, was genuinely fond of her. but every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. among other examples i may instance the following, which my stay at balbec brought to my knowledge-mme. de villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from m. de charlus. a month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. he received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. meeting his aunt a few days later in paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. but there was no mistake, replied mme. de villeparisis, the money order cost six francs seventy-five. oh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right, said m. de charlus, i mentioned it only in case you didnt know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didnt know you as well as i do, it might have led to unpleasantness. no, no, there was no mistake. after all, you were quite right, m. de charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunts hand. and in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. but some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had worked up a regular conspiracy against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. i shall not be satisfied with having my revenge, he added as a postscript; i shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. tomorrow i shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand i lent you; i shall disgrace you publicly. instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. but apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. but already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. he had repeated the story, but without mme. de villeparisiss knowledge. with the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. this storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. this sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. of a different order were the quarrels of bloch and his friends. of a dif  ferent order again were those of m. de charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike mme. de villeparisis. in spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations. i say, my uncle and mme. swann are getting warm over there! remarked saint-loup. and look at mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. to the pure all things are pure, i suppose! i studied m. de charlus. the tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. i had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. and yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, i was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to mme. swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the barons knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the tecs to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. m. de chtellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on m. de charluss face that he had seen the young duke until he was actually standing in front of him. in this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, m. de charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to mme. swann. but as she was not certain whether i already knew mme. de marsantes and m. de charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that i might ask her to introduce me to them. i then made my way to m. de charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. as i stood before him and bowed i found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and i was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. this coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage mme. swann to melt from hers. how tired and worried you look, said mme. de marsantes to her son who had come up to greet m. de charlus. and indeed the expression in roberts eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom this bottom which hurt robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress. never mind, his mother went on, stroking his cheek, never mind; its good to see my little boy again. but this show of affection seeming to irritate robert, mme. de marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. mme. swann, finding herself alone and having realised that i was a friend of saint-loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. not having seen her for so long i did not know what to talk to her about. i was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and i asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the duc de guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital g was surmounted by a ducal coronet. i knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be. what a pleasant man m. de norpois is, i said to mme. swann, looking at the ambassador. it is true, robert de saint-loup says hes a pest, but     he is quite right, she replied. seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, i plied her with questions. for the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner. i am sure this is what m. de saint-loup meant, she began, but you must never tell him i said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and i value his esteem very highly; i am an honest injun, dont you know. the other day, charlus was dining at the princesse de guermantess; i dont know how it was, but your name was mentioned. m. de norpois seems to have told them  its all too silly for words, dont go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it  that you were a hypocritical little flatterer. i have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as m. de norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. i was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when i had asked him about mme. swann and gilberte was known to the princesse de guermantes, whom i imagined never to have heard of my existence. each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the world, from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which i used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of mme. swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances  in the present instance to the princesse de guermantes  and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. what we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. it may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. so that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by x-rays. not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. a man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: dromedary resting. later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, i was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: this is you. a few years earlier i should have been only too glad to tell mme. swann in what connexion i had fawned upon m. de norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. but i no longer felt this desire, i was no longer in love with gilberte. on the other hand i had not succeeded in identifying mme. swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. accordingly i spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment. did you see the duchesse de guermantes just now? i asked mme. swann. but since the duchess did not bow to mme. swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark. i dont know; i didnt realise her, she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from england. i was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to mme. de guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of mme. de guermantes i questioned mme de villeparisis about mme. leroi. oh, yes, i know who you mean, she replied with an affectation of contempt, the daughter of those rich timber people. ive heard that shes begun to go about quite a lot lately, but i must explain to you that i am rather old now to make new acquaintances. i have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really i do not believe mme. lerol would be any addition to what i already have. mme. de marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the marquise, presented me to the prince and, while she was still doing so, m. de norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since i had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with french society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the princes honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented. mme. de villeparisis appealed to m. de norpois, feeling it imperative that i should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing mme. leroi. am i not right, m. lambassadeur, mme. leroi is quite uninteresting, isnt she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; i was quite right not to make friends with her, wasnt i? whether from independence or because he was tired, m. de norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning. sir, went on mme. de villeparisis with a laugh, there are some absurd people in the world. would you believe that i had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young womans? i guessed at once that this was legrandin. m. de norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a voisenon or the younger crbillon. many young womens hands would be incapable of doing what i see there, said the prince, pointing to mme. de villeparisiss unfinished water-colours. and he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by fantin-latour which had recently been exhibited. they are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette, declared m. de norpois; i consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which i find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower. even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression. i claim no credit for knowing about flowers, ive lived all my life among the fields, replied mme. de villeparisis modestly. but, she added graciously, turning to the prince, if i did, when i was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, i owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, herr von schlegel. i met him at broglie, when i was staying there once with my aunt cordelia (marshal de castellanes wife, dont you know?). i remember so well m. lebrun, m. de salvandy, m. doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. i was only a little girl, i wasnt able to follow all he said. but he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the val richer, when i fell asleep on his knee. i have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which i should not have noticed otherwise. when mme. de barante published some of mme. de broglies letters, charming and affected like herself, i hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with herr von schlegel. but she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion. robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were. you have been good to me, i said, how can i thank you? can we dine together to-morrow? to-morrow? yes, if you like, but it will have to be with bloch. i met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because i had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (at least, he didnt tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but i guessed it.) but after that he was so friendly to me that i simply cant disappoint him. between ourselves, on his side at least, i can feel its a life and death friendship. nor do i consider that robert was altogether mistaken. furious detraction was often, with bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. and as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a weeks silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. and so i have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. they rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. as for being good, went on saint-loup, you say i have been to you, but i havent been good at all, my aunt tells me that its you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. she wondered whether you had anything against her. fortunately for myself, if i had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which i believed to be imminent, for balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see mme. guermantes again, to assure her that i had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. but i had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her elstirs. besides, this was not a disappointment; i had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; i knew that i did not appeal to her, that i need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that i had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, i might there and then receive, since i should not be seeing her again before i left paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which i could take with me to balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow. mme. de marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because i felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to blochs uncle, m. nissim bernard, mme. de marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at nice. in that case, he knew m. de marsantes there before our marriage, she told me. my husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature. to think that for once in his life he wasnt lying! its incredible, would have been blochs comment. all this time i should have liked to explain to mme. de marsantes that robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. but now that mme. de guermantes had left the room, i had more leisure to observe robert, and i noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. i was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder. suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which mme. de villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. i was hurrying after him when m. de charlus, who must have supposed that i was leaving the house, turned abruptly from prince von faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. i saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital g and a ducal coronet. in the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me: as i see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. but its a little complicated, he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. i am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. but i should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. i am just going. will you walk a short way with me? i shall only keep you a moment. youd better take care, sir, i warned him; you have picked up the wrong hat by mistake. do you want to stop me taking my own hat? i assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that i had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. i told him that i must say a few words to saint-loup. he is still talking to that idiot the duc de guermantes, i added. that really is charming; i shall tell my brother. oh! you think that would interest m. de charlus? (i imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called charlus also. saint-loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at balbec, but i had forgotten the details.) who has been talking to you about m. de charlus? replied the baron in an arrogant tone. go to robert. i hear, he went on, that you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. you would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt. i should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about emerson, ibsen and tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured robert to make him drink nothing but water. in the hope of bringing some balm to robert, whose pride had, i felt, been wounded, i sought to find an excuse for his mistress. i did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. but it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. and as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact. ive come to the conclusion i was wrong about that matter of the necklace, robert said to me. of course, i never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, i know very well, other people dont look at things in the same way as oneself. she had a very hard time when she was young. in her eyes, i was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence boucheron or in a lawsuit. of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when i have never thought of anything but her good. but i do see clearly, she believes that i wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and thats not true. and shes so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, i simply cant tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. how wretched she must be feeling now! in any case, whatever happens in the long run, i dont want to let her think me a cad; i shall dash off to boucherons and get the necklace. you never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that shes been in the wrong. dont you see, its the idea that she is suffering at this moment that i cant bear. what one suffers oneself one knows; thats nothing. but with her  to say to oneself that shes suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels  i think i shall go mad in a minute  id much rather never see her again than let her suffer. she can be happy without me, if she must; thats all i ask. listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; i shall run to the jewellers and then go and ask her to forgive me. but until i get down there what will she be thinking of me? if she could only know that i was on my way! what about your going down there and telling her? for all we know, that might settle the whole business. perhaps, he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, we can all three dine together in the country. but we cant tell yet. i never know how to handle her. poor child. i shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. besides, her decision may be irrevocable. robert swept me back to his mother. good-bye, he said to her. ive got to go now. i dont know when i shall get leave again. probably not for a month. i shall write as soon as i know myself. certainly robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to ones own family is the natural complement to ones ceremonial behaviour. whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. saint-loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which rachels absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons i have been describing are with theirs. and as she listened to him i saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which mme. de marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him. what, robert, youre going away? seriously? my little son! the one day ive seen anything of you! and then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added: you know, its not at all nice of you. but to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that saint-loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. and so he grew angry. its unfortunate, but, nice or not, thats how it is. and he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. but of her own accord mme. de marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him. i shall leave you here, he said to me, but youre not to keep him long, mamma, because hes got to go somewhere else in a minute. i was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to mme. de marsantes, but i preferred, by not going with robert, not to let her suppose that i was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. i should have liked to find some excuse for her sons conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. but it was she who spoke first. poor boy, she began, i am sure i must have hurt him dreadfully. you see, sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasnt many pleasures, he comes so little to paris. oh, dear, if he hadnt gone already i should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that im not vexed with him, that i think he was quite right. will you excuse me if i go and look over the staircase? i accompanied her there. robert! robert! she called. no; hes gone; we are too late. at that moment i would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. in one case saint-loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. yet i was the same man, at an interval of a few hours. we returned to the drawing-room. seeing that saint-loup was not with us, mme. de villeparisis exchanged with m. de norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: there now, theres been trouble. robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. but it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. certain of roberts friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. and yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. i have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. at this moment, roberts friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on rachels part, at this moment she will be in the promenade at the folies-bergres. shes an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx. after all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers? robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. he knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. one could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in rachel. for it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. on one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: she is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, i may as well die  and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps  but no, it can never possibly happen. and in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: you dont know her? i congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined i dont know how many men. there isnt a worse girl in paris. shes a common swindler. and cunning isnt the word! and perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: no, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; i dont say she hasnt had an adventure or two in her time, but shes not a woman one pays, shed be a damned sight too expensive if she was. with her its fifty thousand francs or nothing. well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. there were in paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom saint-loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by rachel. i blame myself for one thing only, mme. de marsantes murmured in my ear, and that was my telling him that he wasnt nice to me. he, such an adorable, unique son, theres no one else like him in the world, the only time i see him, to have told him he wasnt nice to me, i would far rather hed beaten me, because i am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasnt many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. but, sir, i mustnt keep you, since youre in a hurry. anxiously, mme. de marsantes bade me good-bye. these sentiments bore upon robert; she was sincere. but she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more. i have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. thank you! thank you! and with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. these charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business. but i am in no hurry, i replied; besides, i must wait for m. de charlus; i am going with him. mme. de villeparisis overheard these last words. they appeared to vex her. had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in mme. de villeparisis was her modesty. but this hypothesis never even entered my mind. i was delighted with mme. de guermantes, with saint-loup, with mme. de marsantes, with m. de charlus, with mme. de villeparisis; i did not stop to reflect, and i spoke light-heartedly and at random. youre going from here with my nephew palamde? she asked me. thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on mme. de villeparisis if she learned that i was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, he has asked me to go home with him, i answered blithely. i am so glad. besides, we are greater friends than you think, and ive quite made up my mind that were going to be better friends still. from being vexed, mme. de villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. dont wait for him, she said to me, with a preoccupied air. he is talking to m. de faffenheim. hes certain to have forgotten what he said to you. youd much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned. the first emotion shewn by mme. de villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. i was not, myself, in any hurry to join robert and his mistress. but mme. de villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, i bade her good-bye. next to her m. de guermantes, superb and olympian, was ponderously seated. one would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. at the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and i could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned french breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. i seemed to be looking at that statue of olympian zeus which phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. such was the power that good breeding had over m. de guermantes over the body of m. de guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. m. de guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other peoples. as i went downstairs i heard behind me a voice calling out to me: so this is how you wait for me, is it? it was m. de charlus. you dont mind if we go a little way on foot? he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. we can walk until i find a cab that suits me. you wished to speak to me about something, sir? oh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things i wished to say to you, but i am not so sure now whether i shall. as far as you are concerned, i am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. but i can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. i ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that i should have to take with you, and i have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. perhaps also to you yourself what i could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for i repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble. i protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. this summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking. that sort of politeness means nothing, he rebuked me coldly. there is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth ones while. for the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. in the heart of our tub, like diogenes, we cry out for a man. we cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. but we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. that is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. are you worth my trouble or not? i would not for anything in the world, sir, be a cause of anxiety to you, i said to him, but so far as i am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. i am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me. greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone. with the want of consideration common at your age, he told me, you are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. what you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you. as he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, m. de charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when i saw him outside the casino at balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside mme. swann, whom i supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. but m. de charlus immediately dismissed them. theyre not what i want, he explained to me, its all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction theyre going in. i hope, sir, he went on, that you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which i am going to make to you. i was struck by the similarity of his diction to swanns, closer now than at balbec. you have enough intelligence, i suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that i have recourse to you. i do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard  it was alluded to in a leading article in the times, which made a considerable impression  that the emperor of austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the comte de chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of european politics as myself he would be king of france to-day. i have often thought, sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which i have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom i would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what i am perhaps alone in possessing. i do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. and i do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances. (this was a favourite expression with m. de charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) i could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future. m. de charlus broke off to question me about bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunts drawing-room. and with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. he asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with m. de norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether m. de charlus was for or against drey, fus. it is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life, went on m. de charlus when he had finished questioning me, to include among your friends an occasional foreigner. i replied that bloch was french. indeed, said m. de charlus, i took him to be a jew. his assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that m. de charlus was more anti-dreyfusard than anyone i had met. he protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against dreyfus. but his protest took this form: i understand the newspapers to say that dreyfus has committed a crime against his country  so i understand, i pay no attention to the newspapers, i read them as i wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what i am doing. in any case, the crime is non-existent, your friends compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed judaea, but what has he to do with france? i pointed out that if there should be a war the jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. perhaps so, and i am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. if we bring over senegalese and malagasies, i hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending france, which is only natural. your dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. but we need not discuss that. perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the temple, at a circumcision, with jewish chants. he might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of saint-cyr performed scenes taken from the psalms by racine, to amuse louis xiv. you might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. for instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as david smote goliath. that would make quite an amusing farce. he might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his haggart) of a mother. that would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-european creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel. as he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, m. de charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. i reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose moliresque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, i felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research. i warned him that, anyhow, mme. bloch no longer existed, while as for m. bloch, i questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. m. de charlus seemed annoyed. that, he said, is a woman who made a great mistake in dying. as for blinding him, surely the synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the gospel. in any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports. at this point i caught sight of m. bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. he did not see us but i offered to introduce him to m. de charlus. i had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. introduce him to me! but you must have singularly little idea of social values! people do not get to know me as easily as that. in the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. at the most, if i am ever permitted to enjoy the asiatic spectacle which i suggested to you, i might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. but on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, i might go so far as to express my satisfaction. as it happened, m. bloch paid no attention to us. he was occupied in greeting mme. sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. i was surprised at this, for in the old days at combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. but dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted m. bloch to her feet. my fathers friend had found mme. sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. he had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: m. drumont has the impudence to put the revisionists in the same bag as the protestants and the jews. a delightful promiscuity! bernard, he had said with pride, on reaching home, to m. nissim bernard, you know, she has that prejudice! but m. nissim bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. saddened by the misfortunes of the jews, remembering his old friendships with christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. all this dreyfus business, went on the baron, still clasping me by the arm, has only one drawback. it destroys society (i do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of mr. and mrs. camels and camelfies and camelyards, astonishing creatures whom i find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the patrie franaise, or the anti-jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification. this frivolity in m. de charlus brought out his family likeness to the duchesse de guermantes. i remarked to him on the resemblance. as he appeared to think that i did not know her, i reminded him of the evening at the opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. he assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that i should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that m. de charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me. let us return to yourself, he said, and my plans for you. there exists among certain men, sir, a freemasonry of which i cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of europe now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. that is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. yes, sir, that is a fact you remember the story of the man who believed that he had the princess of china shut up in a bottle. it was a form of insanity. he was cured of it, but as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. there are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. a cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. the most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. i took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom i could tell you a great deal). he guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. but my cousin had nephritis also. what the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. understand that, if i do you a great service, i expect my reward from you to be no less great. it is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. i have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. i have had great sorrows, sir, of which i may tell you perhaps some day; i have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. i have young relatives who are not  i do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which i have been speaking. for all i know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life i shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. my own would gain in return. perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy i might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. but before i can tell i must see you often, very often, every day. i was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on m. de charluss part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, i felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. it was m. de charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of m. dargencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. on seeing us, m. dargencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than ones own with which mme. de guermantes had quizzed bloch, and tried to avoid us. but one would have said that m. de charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. and fearing perhaps that m. dargencourt had not recognised me, m. de charlus informed him that i was a great friend of mme. de villeparisis, of the duchesse de guermantes, of robert de saint-loup, and that he himself, charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. nevertheless i observed that m. dargencourt, albeit i had barely been introduced to him at mme. de villeparisiss, and m. de charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. he watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moments hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew. i am sorry about that, said m. de charlus. that fellow argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. i hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and i hope also that you will honour me by keeping it  as i shall  well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast. the duchesse de guermantes seems to be very clever. we were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. it appears that she is specially well informed on that subject. she is nothing of the sort, replied m. de charlus tartly. women, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what i was going to tell you. my sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of balzacs novels, when women had an influence on politics. going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. that was one of the very things i was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. the first sacrifice that you must make for me  i shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts i bestow on you  is to give up going into society. it distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. you may remind me that i was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. and then, i need not point out how invaluable i can be to you. the open sesame to the guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me i shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation. i thought i would take advantage of what m. de charlus had said about my call on mme. de villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than i had intended, and i asked him instead what the villeparisis family was. that is absolutely as though you had asked me what the nobody family was, replied m. de charlus. my aunt married, for love, a m thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself marquis de villeparisis. it did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! what his reason was i cannot tell; i suppose he was actually a monsieur de villeparisis, a gentleman born at villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside paris. my aunt tried to make out that there was such a marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; i cant tell you why. when one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms. mme. de villeparisis being merely mme. thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when i had seen the composite nature of her party. i felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. now that she had become once again what i had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. she did not cease to be charming to us all. i went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. but i had never any impression that she belonged to the faubourg saint-germain, and if i had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom i should have applied. at present, went on m. de charlus, by going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesnt concern me, indeed i can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving, he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. but the choice of your men friends is more important. eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. wait, now, my nephew saint-loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. as far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that i am sufficient. and really when alls said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that i know of. at any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows. i did not know the meaning of this slang word renter; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. people in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. a proof of innocence in their eyes. but they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. he is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious. i could not help smiling at this epithet serious, to which the intonation that m. de charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of virtuous, of steady, as one says of a little shop-girl that she is serious. at this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. m. de charlus instantly stopped him. the driver began to argue. which way are you going? yours. this surprised me, for m. de charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps. well, i dont want to get up on the box. dyou mind if i stay down here? no; but you must put down the hood. well, think over my proposal, said m. de charlus, preparing to leave me, i give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. i repeat, i shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, i must say, to furnish. but in the course of my life i have been so often taken in by appearances that i never wish to trust them again. damn it, its the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure i should know into what hands it is going to pass. very well, bear in mind what im offering you; you are like hercules (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. hallo! he turned to the cabman, havent you put the hood down? ill do it myself. i think, too, id better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in. he jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off. as for myself, no sooner had i turned in at our gate than i found the pendant to the conversation which i had heard exchanged that afternoon between bloch and m. de norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. this was a dispute between our butler, who believed in dreyfus, and the guermantes, who was an anti-dreyfusard. the truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival leagues, the patrie franaise and the droits de lhomme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. m. reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against france, according to some) that the world has ever seen. in two years he replaced a billot by a clemenceau ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the ministry of war. perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. when we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. the case of the guermantes butler and our own was peculiar. the waves of the two currents of dreyfusism and anti-dreyfusism which now divided france from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. when you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. the two butlers whom i heard arguing as i came in furnished an exception to the rule. ours let it be understood that dreyfus was guilty, the guermantes butler that he was innocent. this was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the dukes butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. the dukes butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the devils isle of an innocent man. the porter looked on. i had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the guermantes household. i went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. for some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. it is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. but to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. my grandmothers attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. when the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. if the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. these can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: ill? youre sure its not what they call a diplomatic illness? he tried to soothe his patients restlessness by a milk diet. but incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). for, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years time. so that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. cottard had told us to take her temperature. a thermometer was fetched. throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. it seemed dead. the glass reed was slipped into my grandmothers mouth. we had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. we found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmothers mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. for the first time we felt some anxiety. we shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patients fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmothers lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. we had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. we made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: very well; i have nothing to say; if its like that you may pass, this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. but sullenly she seemed to be saying: what use will that be to you? since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. and then she will grow tired of telling me, i know her; get along with you. this wont last for ever. and then youll be a lot better off. thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earths first inhabitant  long anterior to the creation of thinking man  she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. in a moment a trampled python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. and she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. meanwhile the thermometer, like a weird sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of dr. du boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. but ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. so, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind i gave dr. du boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other mens perceives the truth. i knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. ah! i dont know about that. its quite possible, put in franoise, who was in the room and heard charcots name, as she heard du boulbons, for the first time but this in no way prevented her from saying its possible. her possibles, her perhapses, her i dont knows were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. one wanted to say to her: naturally you dont know, since you havent the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether its possible or not; you know nothing about it. anyhow, you cant say now that you dont know what charcot said to du boulbon. you do know because we have just told you, and your perhapses and possibles dont come in, because its a fact. in spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as i knew that du boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, i begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. what decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. in vain might she answer us in the words of mme. de svigns letter on mme. de la fayette: everyone said she was mad not to wish to go out. i said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: mme. de la fayette is not mad! and i stuck to that. it has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out. du boulbon when he came decided against  if not mme. de svign, whom we did not quote to him  my grandmother, at any rate. instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about bergotte. i should think so, indeed, hes magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. but which of his books do you prefer? indeed! well, perhaps that is the best after all. in any case it is the best composed of his novels. claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most? i supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. but afterwards i realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmothers memory was in good order. as though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (his voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. and under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.) you will be quite well, madame, on the day  when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day  on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. you tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out? but, sir, i have a temperature. he laid a finger on her wrist. not just now, at any rate. besides, what an excuse! dont you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102? but i have a little albumen as well. you ought not to know anything about that. you have what i have had occasion to call mental albumen. we have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. for one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as i am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. a belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. do you imagine, madame, that i needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if i may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you? your grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the champs-elyses, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little, said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting dr. du boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. the doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: go to the champs-elyses, madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. the laurel you will find health-giving. it purifies. after he had exterminated the serpent python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that apollo made his entry into delphi. he sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. so you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, i will add  what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value  the most beautiful of antiseptics. in as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. thus it was with the superior smile of a parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that dr. du boulbon said to my grandmother: probably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect. on the contrary, sir, when the wind blows i can never sleep at all. but doctors are touchy people. ach! muttered du boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmothers sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. he had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a superior person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity. my mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from bergottes friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week. you see, madame, i didnt know that, and yet i could have told you. but, sir, i am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed, said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctors theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis. why, naturally, madame, you cannot have all the forms of  if youll excuse my saying so  mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. yesterday i visited a home for neurasthenics. in the garden, i saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. on my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: you see, doctor, i am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; i have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while i was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. if i move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, i am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis. which he would, in fact, have done. youre a fine specimen of neurasthenia, thats what you are, i told him. and do you know what argument he advanced to prove that i was mistaken? it was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. he prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. you must not be offended by the comparison, madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. that poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that i know. submit to being called a neurotic. you belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. all the greatest things we know have come to us from neurotics. it is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. we enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, madame, he added with a smile at my grandmother, for confess now, when i came into the room, you were not feeling very confident you thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. and you were not mistaken; they were there. neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. there is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. it will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. if it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? no, no; you mustnt think im making fun of your sufferings. i should not undertake to heal them unless i understood them thoroughly. and, well, they say theres no good confession unless its mutual. i have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. what is more, he added, raising a solemn forefinger, there can be no great scientist either. i will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, i wont say a good doctor, but i do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. in nervous pathology a doctor who doesnt say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. i, madame, i do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, i have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but i can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. and in that home where i found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, i had gone to secure a room, for  this is between ourselves  i spend my holidays there looking after myself when i have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people. but do you want me to take a cure like that, sir? came to a frightened voice from my grandmother. it is not necessary, madame. the symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom i appoint as your doctor from now onwards. that is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. even if i knew how to cure you of that, i should take good care not to. all i need do is to control it. i see on your table there one of bergottes books. cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. well, i might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. but those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. no; i have nothing to say against your nervous energy. all i ask is that it should listen to me; i leave you in its charge. it must reverse its engines. the force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. you neednt tell me that you are fatigued. fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. begin by not thinking it. and if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadnt it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what m. de talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called imaginary health. see, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, i have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. well, madame, i shall now bid you good-day. when, after seeing dr. du boulbon to the door, i returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, i felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, i felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; i tried to speak to mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, i stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that i knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. franoise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. she was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. it had required the duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. for she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal place if only she didnt listen to stories. during the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmothers illness and to inquire for news of her. saint-loup had written to me: i do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. but i should not be speaking the truth were i to say to you, even out of politeness, that i shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal. but some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the champs-elyses, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. i had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. when my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey dr. du boulbons orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the champs-elyses. it would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where i should meet them later; and i should still be in time, if i made haste, to take the train with them to ville davray. when the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. but my mother, acting on du boulbons instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. she was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. the sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. as franoise had not had time to send a tube to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. she very kindly consented, however, to call first at jupiens, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. returning at that moment from my morning walk i accompanied her into the shop. is it your young master who brings you here, jupien asked franoise, is it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both? for all his want of education, jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as m. de guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. with franoise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. having obstinately refused to let mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that i knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, i felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that i had an appointment with my friends and was dining at ville davray. in my impatience i finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after i had twice been told that she was just ready. at last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as i was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage. oh, dear, if youre going to meet your friends i ought to have put on another cloak. i look rather poverty-stricken in this one. i was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. when we left the cab at the end of the avenue gabriel, in the champs-elyses, i saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which i had once waited for franoise. the same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to franoises marquise when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, i climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. at the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the marquise, at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. but i do not suppose that she recognised me. the park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side. so youre still here? he was saying. you dont think of retiring? and what have i to retire for, sir? will you kindly tell me where i shall be better off than here, where i should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? and then theres all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little paris, i call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything thats going on. just to give you an example, theres one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; hes a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. very well, sir, she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, for the last eight years, do you follow me, every day god has made, regularly on the stroke of three hes been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. there was one day he didnt come. i never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden i said to myself: why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps hes dead! and that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, i get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. and so i was very glad when i saw him come in again next day, and i said to him, i did: i hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, sir? then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and hed been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadnt been able to come. he had that really sad look, you know, people have when theyve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. you could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. i did what i could to make him feel at home. i said to him: y mustnt let go of things, sir. just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow. the marquise resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god. and besides, she went on, i choose my customers, i dont let everyone into my little parlours, as i call them. and doesnt the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? such friendly customers i have; theres always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are. the thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape  or of being condemned only by default  from an adverse judgment, i moved towards the exit. but it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the marquise, thinking that i was bored, turned to me. you wouldnt like me to open a little place for you? and, on my declining: no? youre sure you wont? she persisted, smiling. well, just as you please. youre welcome to it, but i know quite well, not having to pay for a thing wont make you want to do it if you dont want to. at this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. but she did not belong to the marquises world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her: ive nothing disengaged, maam. will they be long? asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat. well, maam, if youll take my advice, youll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and ive only one closet; the others are out of order. not much money there, she explained when the other had gone. its not the sort we want here, either; theyre not clean, dont treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. im not sorry to lose her penny. finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, i beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the marquise would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. i expected her to begin: i am afraid ive kept you waiting; i hope youll still be in time for your friends, but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, i was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her i noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. i was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. i studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch. i was afraid you were feeling sick, grandmamma; are you feeling better now? i asked her. probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer. i heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper, she told me. could anything have been more typical of the guermantes, or the verdurins and their little circle? heavens, what fine language she put it all in! and she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special marquise, mme. de svign: as i listened to them i thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell. such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. but i guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again. come! i said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, since your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? i dont want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the champs-elyses. i didnt like to suggest it, because of your friends, she replied. poor boy! but if you dont mind, i think it would be wiser. i was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words. come! i said to her sharply, you mustnt tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, its silly; wait till we get home. she smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. she had realised that there was no need to hide from me what i had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke. we made our way back along the avenue gabriel, through the strolling crowd. i left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. she, in whose heart i always placed myself when i had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, i was obliged to keep from her what i thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. i could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. she had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, i had entrusted for all time to her keeping. she was not yet dead. i was already alone. and even those allusions which she had made to the guermantes, to mme. de svign, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be. well, sir, i dont like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. you surely have a doctor of your own. i cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. its a question of professional etiquette     just as i was signalling to a cabman, i had caught sight of the famous professor e  almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the avenue gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. but he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him. but, sir, i am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what i am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what i am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hours time, when i have taken her home. call at your house! really, sir, you must not expect me to do that. i am dining with the minister of commerce. i have a call to pay first. i must change at once, and to make matters worse i have torn my coat and my other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. i beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. you dont know how the lift works; one cant be too careful. getting that buttonhole made means more delay. well, as i am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once i will see her. but i warn you that i shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more. i had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which professor e-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so. we may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death  or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again  may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. you make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a months time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the champs-elyses. perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death  in this kind of first contact with death  because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. a good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. a drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six oclock, as we came home from the champs-elyses, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. legrandin, making his way towards the place de la concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. i, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. my grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: what does it matter? it is not of the least importance. yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when i was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the avenue gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. but would that have been really true? the seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue  for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium  has no need of energy. but in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle. and if legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. she had appeared to them, although i was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when i looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the champs-elyses, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. i have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. she had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. but it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a sociable neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. a terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. a woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. the sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. she does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. is he a criminal? one morning, she can no longer hear him. he has gone. ah! if it were only for ever! in the evening he has returned. what are his plans? her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. or rather it is not the mistresss part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. they are only third parties. the person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us. i helped my grandmother into professor es lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. but there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. he had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. his examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. he continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. he even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though i should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. i then remembered that m. fallires, the president of the senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the presidency of the republic. my confidence in my grandmothers prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as i was recalling the example of m. fallires, i was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the professors jokes. after which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. i waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth. there is not the slightest hope, he informed me. it is a stroke brought on by uraemia. in itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. i need not tell you that i hope i am mistaken. anyhow, you have cottard, youre in excellent hands. excuse me, he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. i told you, im dining with the minister of commerce, and i have a call to pay first. ah! life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age. and he graciously offered me his hand. i had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. the maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. this would take another ten minutes. the professor continued to storm while i stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. each of us is indeed alone. we started for home. the sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some pompeian terra-cotta. at length we arrived at the house. i made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. i told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. as soon as i began to speak, my mothers face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that i realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. she asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when franoise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. she came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. my grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at mamma. i had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. i had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her god, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferers face. perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. so they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes. meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmothers altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was franoise. not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mothers arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh. when, thanks to the faultless ministrations of franoise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. and at once she was anxious not to fail mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass. well, my child, she began, taking my mothers hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. so this is all the pity you shew your mother! you look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing! then for the first time my mothers eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil: mamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that. and embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. my grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. but she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused franoise unjustly of not doing her bed properly). by a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide. my mother and i (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of franoise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that andre was too sorry for al-bertine to be really fond of her. the same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. in a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours. franoise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. and if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still franoise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. she neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. it was true that she had brought from combray an extremely exalted idea of everyones duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should fail us. this doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing  however little they might previously have sought to oblige  to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. but at combray franoise had contracted also  and had brought with her to paris  the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. the sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. and at this moment when my grandmother was so ill franoises duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. she would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. and so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butlers example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. he sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. naturally he expected these to dazzle them. but as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. so much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from lamartine, just as he might have said who laughs last, laughs longest! or merely how are you keeping? to ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. the blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. and the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. the savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. on certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. in this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moments reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: advance eastwards. medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. but, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. to a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. we can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. his nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. one consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. when my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: oh, its dreadful! but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or  an alternative stratagem  repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard. oh! my dear, its dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; i am crying with rage at your orders. but she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs. there is nothing wrong. im complaining because im not lying very comfortably. i feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, i knocked myself against the wall. and my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said: no, no, mamma dear, we wont let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling  no, youre not to move. and stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. my grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to mammas. it was so altered that probably had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. her features, like the clay in a sculptors hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. this business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmothers face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. the veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. but the whole task was not yet accomplished. next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered. in one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist x -he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. people say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as franoise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. the specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like aeoluss bottle. my grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. and we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. according to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. to each of us he said: i should like to have another look at that little cornea. dont put it off too long. i can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle. we were, of course, thinking of something quite different. and yet we asked ourselves: get rid of what? in a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. for by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. each of us had his or her catarrh. and when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. he had examined us at a moment when we were already ill. my grandmothers illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. and the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmothers room. summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave combray. they had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalids bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. mme. sazerat wrote to mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me. he had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. but formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. for he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. according to another version, he had a tumour. he grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, i believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the man with the little beard whom i had seen so alert, not very long since. he was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed. but at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when mme. swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. the general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. but it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards renown. a dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. the effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. in the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by glory. but for bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. he existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. he was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers. the visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for i had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. a mans work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. in the books of bergotte which i constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. all the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. but a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that i could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. he would say, for instance: the hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads (and so far it was simple, i followed him smoothly along those roads) which started every five minutes from briand and claudel. at that point i ceased to understand, because i had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. only i felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but i myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. i would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which i would see things in their novel relations. and each time, after i had got about halfway through the sentence, i would fall back again, as later on, when i joined the army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the bridge-ladder. i felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. and from then onwards i felt less admiration for bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. there was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was renoir. people of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. but in so saying they forget the element of time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before renoir was hailed as a great artist. to succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. the course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. when it is at an end the operator says to us: now look! and, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are renoirs, those renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. the carriages, too, are renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. it will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent. this writer who had taken bergottes place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations  perfectly coherent  which my mind was not trained to follow. the fact that it was always at the same point that i felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that i had always to make. moreover, when once in a thousand times i did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what i saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which i had found long ago in reading bergotte, only more delightful. i reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which i was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by bergotte himself. until i was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in homers day, and science with its continuous progress. perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was i to know that in twenty years time, when i should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned bergotte? i spoke to the latter of the new writer. he gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for bloch. from that moment my friends features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and i no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. if bergotte had decried him to me it was less, i fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. he read scarcely anything. the bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. he had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. his reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. he led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. however, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than i should once have found it, i felt no compunction for that. he was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. i do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. he would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might  very rarely  talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. it did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. and every day she reminded me: see that you dont forget to thank him nicely. we had also  a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painters mistress  a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from mme. cottard. she came to offer us her waiting-woman, or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would scour the country for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. she assured us that the professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. we shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands. offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the hereditary grand duke of luxembourg. i had met him at balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the princesse de luxembourg, being himself at that time merely comte de nassau. he had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another luxembourg princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. whereupon the grand duke of luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew nassau, had obtained the approval of his chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. as with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the brides fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. i remembered this comte de nassau as one of the most striking young men i had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. i was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmothers illness, and mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mothers expressions: svign would not have put it better. on the sixth day mamma, yielding to my grandmothers entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. i should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) franoise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. in spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. she would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. but word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by jupien. this man had been ordered to come before my grandmothers illness. it seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. but franchises code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmothers condition ceased at once to matter. when, after waiting a quarter of an hour, i lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, i found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. franoise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. a typical combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which franoise extended even to foreign politics. people foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. a thousand times over franoise told the gardener at combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. yet, when the russo-japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the poor russians, since, she reminded us, were allianced to them. she felt this abstention to be not quite polite to nicholas ii, who had always said such nice things about us; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from jupien, knowing that it would upset her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at deaths door, the same meanness of which she considered france guilty in remaining neutral with regard to japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble. luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of franoises daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. to the regular stock of advice which people at combray gave to the family of an invalid: you havent tried taking him away for a little    the change of air, you know    pick up an appetite    etc? she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of peoples heads: she ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first. she did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were radical. as for franoise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. she had, in the south of france, some cousins  relatively well-to-do  whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. now all this seemed to franoise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a place in the country. they themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. they had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. the ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. the father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. franoise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmothers sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre. there came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmothers eyes. for some days she could not see at all. her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. and i gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. for several days my grandmother was deaf. and as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. but the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with ones eyes. finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. we were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said. and now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. when she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. she made no effort to think. then came a state of perpetual agitation. she was incessantly trying to get up. but we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. one day when she had been left alone for a moment i found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window. at balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery  so obscure, for all that  of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom. we were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders. the look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman.    by dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, franoise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. she armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de cologne, a wrapper. it cant hurt madame amde, she said to herself, if i just comb her; nobodys ever too ill for a good combing. in other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. but when i came into the room i saw between the cruel hands of franoise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. i felt that the moment at which franoise would have finished her task was approaching, and i dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: that is enough, for fear of her disobeying me. but i did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, franoise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. i was glad for the moment that i had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. but, alas, when, a moment later, i leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me. according to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. it must be relieved in some way. cottard was in two minds. franoise hoped at first that they were going to apply clarified cups. she looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. even if she had said scarified instead of clarified she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under s than under c; she did indeed say clarified but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) esclarified. cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. when, a few hours later, i went into my grandmothers room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of medusa. but in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face i saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. she realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that i should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand. i knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. i knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. and so it infuriated me to hear franoise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: oh, look at the little beasties running about on madame. this was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. but my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her. alas! no sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. i was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, franoise was constantly disappearing. the fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. in the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of trying-on. a few days later, when i was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. with that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others: forgive me for disturbing your sleep, she said to me. i was not asleep, i answered as i awoke. i said this in good faith. the great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. the tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. but then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. a little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. and when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: i was asleep. in a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on: my poor boy, you have only your papa and mamma to help you now. we went into the sickroom. bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. the eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. all this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. but if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? yes, i could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing. mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmothers forehead. it was the only thing that refreshed her, thought mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. but now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. the news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. one of those extra helps whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the duc de guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: i could not escape him. i have just, my dear sir, heard your tragic news. i should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father. i made the excuse that i could not very well disturb him at the moment. m. de guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. but he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. as a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready. have you sent for dieulafoy? no? that was a great mistake. and if you had only asked me, i would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the duchesse de chartres before now. you see, i set myself above a princess of the blood. however, in the presence of death we are all equal, he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the duchesse de chartres would not be in very good taste. this advice did not in the least surprise me. i knew that, in the guermantes set, the name of dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were quite the best in their respective lines. and the old duchesse de mortemart neguermantes (i never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a duchess, one almost invariably says: the old duchess of so-and-so or, alternatively, in a delicate watteau tone, if she is still young: the little duchess of so-and-so,) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: dieulafoy, dieulafoy! as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: poir blanche, or for small pastry rebattet, rebattet. but i was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for dieulafoy. at this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find m. de guermantes. i should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. but convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although i defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of sir, sir, sir, dragged me across to mamma, saying: will you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother? letting go a little as he came to the last word. and it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. there was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. he apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of m. de guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of saint-loup who had arrived in paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. i say, this is a piece of luck! cried the duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. saint-loup was not sorry, i fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. he left the house, carried off by his uncle who  having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to doncires on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. upon my soul, if anybody had told me i had only to cross the courtyard and i should find you here, i should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend m. bloch would say, its a regular farce. and as he disappeared down the stairs with robert whom he held by the shoulder: all the same, he went on, its quite clear i must have touched the hangmans rope or something; i do have the most astounding luck. not that the duc de guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. but he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: this is a very painful occasion, after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a lift in their carriage when it is time to go home. the duc de guermantes, while congratulating himself on the good wind that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception  natural as it was  that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had absent fits during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite all there. at the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what i was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly affected by the sad event. but he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of mammas sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if i was not doing anything to distract her. a half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom i had never seen, had telegraphed to austria, where the head of his order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalids face. at one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this clerics grief began to upset me, and i looked at him tenderly. he appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. he joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that i would then cease to watch him, left, as i observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. and at the moment when my gaze left his face, i saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. he was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. he saw that i was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. i have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. it was tacitly agreed that i had not noticed that he was spying on me. in the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten? the doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. my mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. i had left the room for a few minutes. when i returned i found myself face to face with a miracle. accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. i soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that i had heard before leaving the room. perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmothers breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow. franoise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art  as simple as that need was futile  of giving it expression. regarding my grandmothers case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. and all that she could do was to repeat: it makes me feel all queer, in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: its like a load on my stomach, sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at combray (to which this young parisian now referred as the cambrousse and where she felt herself growing ptrousse, in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, franoise felt, to be a superb spectacle. knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. she knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. she was determined at least to go over it all with him on his return. for several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. he was always sent for in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. i could tell already that mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions: promise me that you wont come to-morrow. please, for her sake. at any rate, you wont go all the way. its what she would have wished. but there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive at the house, by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of no flowers by request. and before attending everything he had always attended to everything, which entitled him to the formula: we dont know how to thank you. whats that? came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father. nothing, answered the cousin. i was just saying that id heard from combray this morning. the weather is appalling down there, and here weve got too much sun. yet the barometer is very low, put in my father. where did you say the weather was bad? asked my grandfather. at combray. ah! im not surprised; whenever its bad here its fine at combray, and vice versa. good gracious! talking of combray, has anyone remembered to tell legrandin? yes, dont worry about that, its been done, said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having remembered it. at this point my father hurried from the room. i supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. it was simply that dr. dieulafoy had just arrived. my father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. we had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. dr. dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. the mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: m. dieulafoy, one imagined oneself at a play by molire. to the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. a face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. in the sable majesty of his frock coat the professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. at the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the duc de guermantes who was the great gentleman having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom i felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: professor dieulafoy. but already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. he had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurers nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity  which was increased rather  of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. the slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. for he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. that eminent man is no longer with us. other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. but the capacity in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. mamma had not even noticed m. dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. i remember (and here i anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: old norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, hell be so gratified if you do, my mother, when the ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. a couple of days earlier  to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying  while they were watching by the body, franoise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: i believe thats her. but in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still. to return now to those last hours, you heard about the telegram her sisters sent us? my grandfather asked the cousin. yes, beethoven, they told me about it, its worth framing; still, im not surprised. my poor wife, who was so fond of them, too, said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. we mustnt blame them. theyre stark mad, both of them, as ive always said. whats the matter now; arent you going on with the oxygen? my mother spoke: oh, but then mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing. the doctor reassured her: oh, no! the effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently. it seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. the hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, but the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. the doctor stooped to feel my grandmothers pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. and the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. who knows whether, without indeed my grandmothers being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? one would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. at the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. they made me dry my eyes before i went up to kiss my grandmother. but i thought she couldnt see anything now? said my father. one can never be sure, replied the doctor. when my lips touched her face, my grandmothers hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. franoise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. remembering what the doctor had just said i tried to make her leave the room. at that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. i thrust myself hurriedly in front of franoise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. the sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. my grandmother was dead. an hour or two later franoise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. but now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. as at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. a smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmothers lips. on that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young maiden.embed"

9,"it is common to think of our own time as standing at the apex of civilization, from which the deficiencies of preceding ages may patronizingly be viewed in the light of what is assumed to be ""progress."" the reality is that in the long perspective of history the present century will not hold an admirable position, unless its second half is to redeem its first. these two-score years in the twentieth century will be recorded in the book of years as one of the most bloody in all annals. two world wars have left a legacy of dead which number more than all the armies engaged in any way that made ancient or medieval history. no half-century ever witnessed slaughter on such a scale, such cruelties and inhumanities, such wholesale deportations of peoples into slavery, such annihilations of minorities. the terror of torquemada pales before the nazi inquisition. these deeds are the overshadowing historical facts by which generations to come will remember this decade. if we cannot eliminate the causes and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization. goaded by these facts, we were moved to redress the blight on the record of our era. the defendants complain that our pace is too fast. in drawing the charter of this tribunal, we thought we were recording an accomplished advance in international law. but they say we have outrun our times, that we have anticipated an advance that should be, but has not yet been made. the agreement of london, whether it originates or merely records, at all events marks a transition in international law which roughly corresponds to that in the evolution of local law when men ceased to punish crime by ""hue and cry"" and began to let reason and inquiry govern punishment. the society of nations has emerged from the primitive ""hue and cry,"" the law of ""catch and kill."" it seeks to apply sanctions to enforce international law, but to guide their application by evidence, law, and reason instead of outcry. the defendants denounce the law under which their accounting is asked. their dislike for the law which condemns them is not original. it has been remarked before that: ""no thief e'er felt the halter draw with good opinion of the law."" i shall not labor the law of this case. the position of the united states was explained in my opening statement. my distinguished colleague, the attorney general of great britain, will reply on behalf of all the chief prosecutors to the defendants' legal attack. at this stage of the proceedings, i shall rest upon the law of these crimes as laid down in the charter. the defendants, who except for the charter would have no right to be heard at all, now ask that the legal basis of this trial be nullified. this tribunal, of course, is given no power to set aside or modify the agreement between the four powers, to which 18 other nations have adhered. the terms of the charter are conclusive upon every party to these proceedings. in interpreting the charter, however, we should not overlook the unique and emergent character of this body as an international military tribunal. it is no part of the constitutional mechanism of internal justice of any of the signatory nations. germany has unconditionally surrendered, but no peace treaty has been signed or agreed upon. the allies are still technically in a state of war with germany, although the enemy's political and military institutions have collapsed. as a military tribunal, this tribunal is a continuation of the war effort of the allied nations. as an international tribunal, it is not bound by the procedural and substantive refinements of our respective judicial or constitutional systems, nor will its rulings introduce precedents into any country's- internal system of civil justice. as an international military tribunal, it rises above the provincial and transient and seeks guidance not only from international law but also from the basic principles of jurisprudence which are assumptions of civilization and which long have found embodiment in the codes of all nations. of one thing we may be sure. the future will never have to ask, with misgiving, what could the nazis have said in their favor. history will know that whatever could be said, they were allowed to say. they have been given the kind of a trial which they, in the days of their pomp and power, never gave to any man. but fairness is not weakness. the extraordinary fairness of these hearings is an attribute of our strength. the prosecution's case, at its close, seemed inherently unassailable because it rested so heavily on german documents of unquestioned authenticity. but it was the weeks upon weeks of pecking at this case, by one after another of the defendants, that has demonstrated its true strength. the fact is that the testimony of the defendants has removed any doubt of guilt which, because of the extraordinary nature and magnitude of these crimes, may have existed before they spoke. they have helped write their own judgment of condemnation. but justice in this case has nothing to do with some of the arguments put forth by the defendants or their counsel. we have not previously and we need not now discuss the merits of all their obscure and tortuous philosophy. we are not trying them for the possession of obnoxious ideas. it is their right, if they choose, to renounce the hebraic heritage in the civilization of which germany was once a part. nor is it our affair that they repudiated the hellenic influence as well. the intellectual bankruptcy and moral perversion of the nazi regime might have been no concern of international law had it not been utilized to goosestep the herrenvolk across international frontiers. it is not their thoughts, it is their overt acts which we charge to be crimes. their creed and teachings are important only as evidence of motive, purpose, knowledge, and intent. we charge unlawful aggression but we are not trying the motives, hopes, or frustrations which may have led germany to resort to aggressive war as an instrument of policy. the law, unlike politics, does not concern itself with the good or evil in the status quo, nor with the merits of the grievances against it. it merely requires that the status quo be not attacked by violent means and that policies be not advanced by war. we may admit that overlapping ethnological and cultural groups, economic barriers, and conflicting national ambitions created in the 1930's, as they will continue to create, grave problems for germany as well as for the other peoples of europe. we may admit too that the world had failed to provide political or legal remedies which would be honorable and acceptable alternatives to war. we do not underwrite either the ethics or the wisdom of any country, including my own, in the face of these problems. but we do say that it is now, as it was for sometime prior to 1939, illegal and criminal for germany or any other nation to redress grievances or seek expansion by resort to aggressive war. let me emphasize one cardinal point. the united states has no interest which would be advanced by the conviction of any defendant if we have not proved him guilty on at least one of the counts charged against him in the indictment. any result that the calm and critical judgment of posterity would pronounce unjust would not be a victory for any of the countries associated in this prosecution. but in summation we now have before us the tested evidences of criminality and have heard the flimsy excuses and paltry evasions of the defendants. the suspended judgment with which we opened this case is no longer appropriate. the time has come for final judgment and if the case i present seems hard and uncompromising, it is because the evidence makes it so. i perhaps can do no better service than to try to lift this case out of the morass of detail with which the record is full and put before you only the bold outlines of a case that is impressive in its simplicity. true, its thousands of documents and more thousands of pages of testimony deal with an epoch and cover a continent, and touch almost every branch of human endeavor. they illuminate specialties, such as diplomacy, naval development and warfare, land warfare, the genesis of air warfare, the politics of the nazi rise to power, the finance and economics of totalitarian war, sociology, penology, mass psychology, and mass pathology. i must leave it to experts to comb the evidence and write volumes on their specialties, while i picture in broad strokes the offenses whose acceptance as lawful could threaten the continuity of civilization. i must, as kipling put it, ""splash at a 10-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair."" the crimes of the nazi regime. the strength of the case against these defendants under the conspiracy count, which it is the duty of the united states to argue, is in its simplicity. it involves but three ultimate inquiries: first, have the acts defined by the charter as crimes been committed; second, were they committed pursuant to a common plan or conspiracy; third, are these defendants among those who are criminally responsible? the charge requires examination of a criminal policy, not of a multitude of isolated, unplanned, or disputed crimes. the substantive crimes upon which we rely, either as goals of a common plan or as means for its accomplishment, are admitted. the pillars which uphold the conspiracy charge may be found in five groups of overt acts, whose character and magnitude are important considerations in appraising the proof of conspiracy. 1. the seizure of power and subjugation of germany to a police state. the nazi party seized control of the german state in 1933. ""seizure of power"" is a characterization used by defendants and defense witnesses, and so apt that it has passed into both history and everyday speech. the nazi junta in the early days lived in constant fear of overthrow. goring, in 1934, pointed out that its enemies were legion and said: ""therefore, the concentration camps have been created, where we have first confined thousands of communists and social democrat functionaries"" in 1933 goring forecast the whole program of purposeful cruelty and oppression when he publicly announced: ""whoever in the future raises a hand against a representative of the national socialist movement or of the state must know that he will lose his life in a very short while"" (2494-ps). new political crimes were created to this end. it was made a treason, punishable with death, to organize or support a political party other than the nazi party (2548-ps). circulating a false or exaggerated statement, or one which would harm the state or even the party, was made a crime (1652-ps). laws were enacted of such ambiguity that they could be used to punish almost any innocent act. it was, for example, made a crime to provoke ""any act contrary to the public welfare"" (1390-ps). the doctrine of punishment by analogy was-introduced to enable conviction for acts which no statute forbade (1962-ps). minister of justice gurtner explained that national socialism considered every violation of the goals of life which the community set up for itself to be a wrong per se, and that the acts could be punished even g though it was not contrary to existing ""formal law"" (2549-ps). the gestapo and the sd were instrumentalities of an espionage system which penetrated public and private life (1680-ps). goring controlled a personal wire-tapping unit. all privacy of communication was abolished (1390-ps). party blockleiter appointed over every 50 householders spied continuously on all within their ken (1893-ps). upon the strength of this spying individuals were dragged off to ""protective custody"" and to concentration camps without legal proceedings of any kind (1956-ps) and without statement of any reason therefore (2533-ps). the partisan political police were exempted from effective legal responsibility for their acts (2347-ps). with all administrative offices in nazi control and with the reichstag reduced to impotence, the judiciary remained the last obstacle to this reign of terror (2469-ps). but its independence was soon overcome and it was reorganized to dispense a venal justice (784-ps) judges were ousted for political or racial reasons and were spied upon and put under pressure to join the nazi party (2967-ps). after the supreme court had acquitted three of the four men whom the nazis accused of setting the reichstag fire, its jurisdiction over treason cases was transferred to a newly established ""people's court"" consisting of two judges and five party officials (2967-ps). the german film of this ""people's court"" in operation, which we showed in this chamber, revealed its presiding judge pouring partisan abuse on speechless defendants (3054-ps). special courts were created to try political crimes, only party members were appointed judges (2065-ps), and ""judges' letters"" instructed the puppet judges as to the ""general lines"" they must follow (d-229). the result was the removal of all peaceable means either to resist or to change the government. having sneaked through the portals of power, the nazis slammed the gate in the face of all others who might also aspire to enter. since the law was what the nazis said it was, every form of opposition was rooted out and every dissenting voice throttled. germany was in the clutch of a police state, which used the fear of the concentration camp as a means to enforce nonresistance. the party was the state, the state was the party, and terror by day and death by night were the policy of both. 2. the preparation and waging of wars of aggression. from the moment the nazis seized power, they set about feverish but stealthy efforts, in defiance of the versailles treaty, to arm for war. in 1933 they found no air force. by 1939 they had 21 squadrons, consisting of 240 echelons or about 2,400 first-line planes, together with trainers and transports. in 1933 they found an army of 3 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. by 1939 they had raised and equipped an army of 51 divisions, 4 of which were fully motorized and 4 of which were panzer divisions. in 1933 they found a navy of 1 cruiser and 6 light cruisers. by 1939 they had built a navy of 4 battleships, 1 aircraft carrier, 6 cruisers, 22 destroyers, and 54 submarines. they had also built up in that period an armament industry as efficient as that of any country in the world (ec-28). these new weapons were put to use, commencing in september 1939, in a series of undeclared wars against nations with which germany had arbitration and nonaggression treaties, and in violation of repeated assurances. on 9/1/1939, this rearmed germany attacked poland. the following april witnessed the invasion and occupation of denmark and norway, and may saw the overrunning of belgium, the netherlands, and luxembourg. another spring saw yugoslavia and greece under attack, and in june 1941 came the invasion of soviet russia. then japan, which germany had embraced as a partner, struck without warning at pearl harbor in december 1941 and 4 days later germany declared war on the united states. we need not trouble ourselves about the many abstract difficulties that can be conjured up about what constitutes aggression in doubtful cases. i shall show you, in discussing the conspiracy, that by any test ever put forward by any responsible authority, by all the canons of plain common sense, these were unlawful wars of aggression in breach of treaties and in violation of assurances. the third group of crimes was: warfare in disregard of international law. it is unnecessary to labor this point on the facts. goring asserts that the rules of land warfare were obsolete, that no nation could fight a total war within their limits. he testified that the nazis would have denounced the conventions to which germany was a party, but that general jodl wanted captured german soldiers to continue to benefit from their observance by the allies. it was, however, against the soviet people and soviet prisoners that teutonic fury knew no bounds, in spite of a warning by admiral canaris that the treatment was in violation of international law. we need not, therefore, for the purposes of the conspiracy count, recite the revolting details of starving, beating, murdering, freezing, and mass extermination admittedly used against the eastern soldiery. also, we may take as established or admitted that the lawless conduct such as shooting british and american airmen, mistreatment of western prisoners of war, forcing french prisoners of war into german war work, and other deliberate violations of the hague and geneva conventions, did occur, and in obedience to highest levels of authority (r-110). the fourth group of crimes is: enslavement and plunder of populations in occupied countries. the defendant sauckel, plenipotentiary general for the utilization of labor (1666-ps), is authority for the statement that ""out of 5,000,000 foreign workers who arrived in germany, not even 200,000 came voluntarily"" (r-124). it was officially reported to defendant rosenberg that in his territory ""recruiting methods were used which probably have their origin in the blackest period of the slave trade"" (294-ps). sauckel himself reported that male and female agents went hunting for men, got them drunk, and ""shanghaied' them to germany (220-ps). these captives were shipped in trains without heat, food, or sanitary facilities. the dead were thrown out at stations, and the newborn were thrown out the windows of moving trains (054-ps). sauckel ordered that ""all the men must be fed, sheltered, and treated in such a way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest conceivable degree of expenditure"" (054-ps). about two million of these were employed directly in the manufacture of armaments and munitions (016-ps). the director of the krupp locomotive factory in essen complained to the company that russian forced laborers were so underfed that they were too weakened to do their work (d-316), and the krupp doctor confirmed their pitiable condition (d-288). soviet workers were put in camps under gestapo guards, who were allowed to punish disobedience by confinement in a concentration camp or by hanging on the spot (3040-ps). populations of occupied countries were otherwise exploited and oppressed unmercifully. terror was the order of the day. civilians were arrested without charges, committed without counsel, executed without hearing. villages were destroyed, the male inhabitants shot or sent to concentration camps, the women sent to forced labor, and the children scattered abroad (3012-ps). the extent of the slaughter in poland alone was indicated by frank, who reported, and i quote: ""if i wanted to have a poster put up for every seven poles who were shot, the forests of poland would not suffice for producing the paper for such posters"" (2032-ps). those who will enslave men cannot be expected to refrain from plundering them. boastful reports show how thoroughly and scientifically the resources of occupied lands were sucked into the german war economy, inflicting shortage, hunger, and inflation upon the inhabitants (ec-317). besides this grand plan to aid the german war effort there were the sordid activities of the rosenberg einsatzstab which pillaged art treasures for goring and his fellow-bandits (014-ps). it is hard to say whether the spectacle of germany's number 2 leader urging his people to give up every comfort-and strain every sinew on essential war work while he rushed around confiscating art by the trainload should be cast as tragedy or comedy. in either case it was a crime. international law at all times before and during this war spoke with precision and authority respecting the protection due civilians of an occupied country and the slave trade and plunder of occupied countries was at all times flagrantly unlawful. and the fifth group of crimes is: persecution and extermination of jews and christians. the nazi movement will be of evil memory in history because of its persecution of the jews, the most far-flung and terrible racial persecution of all time. although the nazi party neither invented nor monopolized anti-semitism, its leaders from the very beginning embraced it, incited it, and exploited it. they used it as ""the psychological spark that ignites the mob."" after the seizure of power it became an official state policy. the persecution began in a series of discriminatory laws eliminating the jews from the civil service, the professions, and economic life. as it became more intense it included segregation of jews in ghettos, and exile. riots were organized by party leaders to loot jewish business places and to burn synagogues. jewish property was confiscated and a collective fine of a billion marks was imposed upon german jewry. the program progressed in fury and irresponsibility to the ""final solution."" this consisted of sending all jews who were fit to work to concentration camps as slave laborers, and all who were not fit, which included children under 12 and people over 50, as well as any others judged unfit by an ss doctor, to concentration camps for extermination (2605-ps). adolf eichmann, the sinister figure who had charge of the extermination program, has estimated that the anti-jewish activities resulted in the killing of 6 million jews. of these, 4 million were killed in extermination institutions, and 2 million were killed by einsatzgruppen, mobile units of the security police and sd which pursued jews in the ghettos and in their homes and slaughtered them by gas wagons, by mass shooting in antitank ditches and by every device which nazi ingenuity could conceive. so thorough and uncompromising was this program that the jews of europe as a race no longer exist, thus fulfilling the diabolic ""prophecy"" of adolf hitler at the beginning of the war (2738-ps). of course, any such program must reckon with the opposition of the christian church. this was recognized from the very beginning. defendant bormann wrote all gauleiters in 1941 that ""national socialism and christian concepts are irreconcilable,"" and that the people must be separated from the churches and the influence of the churches totally removed (d-75). defendant rosenberg even wrote dreary treatises advocating a new and weird nazi religion (2349-ps). the gestapo appointed ""church specialists"" who were instructed that the ultimate aim was ""destruction of the confessional churches"" 1815-ps). the record is full of specific instances of the persecution of clergymen (1164-ps, 1521-ps, 848-ps, 849-ps), the confiscation of church property (1481-ps), interference with religious publications (1498-ps), disruption of religious education (121-ps) and suppression of religious organizations (1481-ps, 1482-ps, r-145). the chief instrumentality for persecution and extermination was the concentration camp, sired by the defendant goring and nurtured under the over-all authority of defendants frick and kaltenbrunner. the horrors of these iniquitous places have been vividly disclosed by documents (2309-ps, 3870-ps) and testified to by witnesses. the tribunal must be satiated with ghastly verbal and pictorial portrayals. from your records it is clear that the concentration camps were the first and worst weapon of nazi oppression used by the national socialist state, and that they were the primary means utilized for the persecution of the christian church and the extermination of the jewish race. this has been admitted to you by some of the defendants from the witness stand. in the words of defendant frank: ""a thousand years will pass and this guilt of germany will still not be erased."" these, then, were the five great substantive crimes of the nazi regime. their commission, which cannot be-denied, stands admitted. the defendant keitel, who is in a position to know the facts, has given the tribunal what seems to be a fair summation of the case on the facts: ""the defendant has declared that he admits the contents of the general indictment to be proved from the objective and factual point of view (that is to say, not every individual case) and this in consideration of the law of procedure governing the trial. it would be senseless, despite the possibility of refuting several documents or individual facts, to attempt to shake the indictment as a whole."" i pass now to the inquiry as to whether these groups of criminal acts were integrated in a common plan or conspiracy. the prosecution submits that these five categories of premeditated crimes were not separate and independent phenomena but that all were committed pursuant to a common plan or conspiracy. the defense admits that these classes of crimes were committed but denies that they are connected one with another as parts of a single program. the central crime in this pattern of crimes, the kingpin which holds them all together, is the plot for aggressive wars. the chief reason for international cognizance of these crimes lies in this fact. have we established the plan or conspiracy to make aggressive war? certain admitted or clearly proven facts help answer that question. first is the fact that such war of aggression did take place. second, it is admitted that from the moment the nazis came to power, every one of them and every one of the defendants worked like beavers to prepare for some war. the question therefore comes to this: were they preparing for the war which did occur, or were they preparing for some war which never has happened? it is probably true that in their early days none of them had in mind what month of what year war would begin, the exact dispute which would precipitate it, or whether its first impact would be austria, czechoslovakia, or poland. but i submit that the defendants either knew or were chargeable with knowledge that the war for which they were making ready would be a war of german aggression. this is partly because there was no real expectation that any power or combination of powers would attack germany. but it is chiefly because the inherent nature of the german plans was such that they were certain sooner or later to meet resistance and that they could then be accomplished only by aggression. the plans of adolf hitler for aggression were just as secret as mein kampf, of which over six million copies were published in germany. he not only openly advocated overthrowing the treaty of versailles, but made demands which went far beyond a mere rectification of its alleged injustices (gb-128). he avowed an intention to attack neighboring states and seize their lands, which he said would have to be won with ""the power of a triumphant sword."" here, for every german to hearken to, were the ""ancestral voices prophesying war."" goring has testified in this courtroom that at his first meeting with hitler, long before the seizure of power, quoting: ""i noted that hitler had a definite view of the impotency of protest and, as a second point, that he was of the opinion that germany should be freed of the peace of versailles. we did not say we shall have to have a war and defeat our enemies; this was the aim, and the methods had to be adapted to the political situation."" when asked if this goal were to be accomplished by war if necessary, goring did not deny that eventuality but evaded a direct answer by saying, ""we did not even debate about those things at that time."" he went on to say that the aim to overthrow the treaty of versailles was open and notorious and that i quote again every german in my opinion was for its modification, and there was no doubt that this was a strong inducement for joining the party."" thus, there can be no possible excuse for any person who aided hitler to get absolute power over the german people, or who took a part in his regime, to fail to know the nature of the demands he would make on germany's neighbors. immediately after the seizure of power the nazis went to work to implement these aggressive intentions by preparing for war. they first enlisted german industrialists in a secret rearmament program. twenty days after the seizure of power schacht was host to hitler, goring, and some 20 leading industrialists. among them were krupp von bohlen of the great krupp armament works and representatives of i. g. farben and other ruhr heavy industries. hitler and goring explained their program to the industrialists, who became so enthusiastic that they set about to raise 3 million reichsmark to strengthen and confirm the nazi party in power (ec-433). two months later krupp was working to bring a reorganized association of german industry into agreement with the political aims of the nazi government (d-157). krupp later boasted of the success in keeping the german war industries secretly alive and in readiness despite the disarmament clauses of the versailles treaty, and recalled the industrialists' enthusiastic acceptance of ""the great intentions of the fuhrer in the rearmament period of 1933-39"" (d-317). some 2 months after schacht had sponsored his first meeting to gain the support of the industrialists, the nazis moved to harness industrial labor to their aggressive plans. in april 1933 hitler ordered dr. ley ""to take over the trade unions,"" numbering some six million members. by party directive ley seized the unions their property and their funds. union leaders, taken into ""protective custody"" by the ss and sa, were put into concentration camps (2283-ps, 2271-ps, 2335-ps, 2334-ps, 2928-ps, 2277-ps, 2332-ps 2333-ps). the free labor unions were then replaced by a nazi organization known as the german labor front, with dr. ley at its head. it was expanded until it controlled over 23 million members (2275-ps). collective bargaining was eliminated, the voice of labor could no longer be heard as to working conditions and the labor contract was prescribed by ""trustees of labor"" appointed by hitler (405-ps). the war purpose of this labor program was clearly acknowledged by robert ley 5 days after war broke out, when he declared in a speech that: ""we national socialists have monopolized all resources and all our energies during the past 7 years so as to be able to be equipped for the supreme effort of battle"" (1939-ps). the nazis also proceeded at once to adapt the government to the needs of war. in april 1933 the cabinet formed a defense council, the working committee of which met frequently thereafter. in the meeting of 5/23/1933 at which defendant keitel presided the members were instructed that: ""no document must be lost since otherwise the enemy propaganda would make use of it. matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they can be denied by us in geneva"" (ec-177). in january 1934and, your honors, dates in this connection are important with defendant jodl present, the council planned a mobilization calendar and mobilization order for some 240,000 industrial plants. again it was agreed that nothing should be in writing so that ""the military purpose may not be traceable"" (ec-404). on 5/21/1935, the top secret reich defense law was enacted. defendant schacht was appointed plenipotentiary for war economy with the task of secretly preparing all economic forces for war and in the event of mobilization, of financing the war (2261-ps). schacht's secret efforts were supplemented in october 1936 by the appointment of defendant goring as commissioner of the four year plan, with the duty of putting the entire economy in a state of readiness for war within 4 years (ec-408). a secret program for the accumulation of the raw materials and foreign credits necessary for extensive rearmament was also set on foot immediately upon seizure of power. in september of 1934, the minister of economics was already complaining that: ""the task of stockpiling is being hampered by the lack of foreign currency; the need for secrecy and camouflage also is a retarding influence"" (ec-128). foreign currency controls were at once established. financing was delegated to the wizard schacht, who conjured up the mefo bill to serve the dual objectives of tapping the short-term money market for rearmament purposes while concealing the amount of these expenditures (ec-436). the spirit of the whole nazi administration was summed up by goring at a meeting of the council of ministers, which included schacht, on 5/27/1936, when he said, ""all measures are to be considered from the standpoint of an assured waging of war"" (1301-ps). the general staff, of course, also had to be enlisted in the war plan. most of the generals, attracted by the prospect of rebuilding their armies, became willing accomplices. the hold-over minister of war von blomberg and the chief of staff general von fritsch, however, were not cordial to the increasingly belligerent policy of the hitler regime, and by vicious and obscene plotting they were discredited and removed in january 1938. thereupon, hitler assumed for himself supreme command of the armed forces and the positions of blomberg and of von fritsch were filled by others who became, as blomberg said of keitel, ""a willing tool in hitler's hands for every one of his decisions."" the generals did not confine their participation to merely military matters. they participated in all major diplomatic and political maneuvers, such as the obersalzberg meeting where hitler, flanked by keitel and other top generals, issued his virtual ultimatum to schuschnigg (1780-ps). as early as 11/5/1937 the plan to attack had begun to take definiteness as to time and victim. in a meeting which included the defendants raeder, goring, and von neurath, hitler stated the cynical objective: ""the question for germany is where the greatest possible conquest could be made at the lowest possible cost."" he discussed various plans for the invasion of austria and czechoslovakia, indicating clearly that he was thinking of these territories not as ends in themselves, but as means for further conquest. he painted out that considerable military and political assistance could be afforded by possession of these lands and discussed the possibility of constituting from them new armies up to a strength of about 12 divisions. the aim he stated boldly and baldly as the acquisition of additional living space in europe, and recognized that ""the german question can be solved only by way of force"" (386-ps). six months later, emboldened by the bloodless austrian conquest, hitler, in a secret directive to keitel, stated his ""unalterable decision to smash czechoslovakia by military action in the near future"" (388-ps). on the same day, jodl noted in his diary that the fuhrer had stated his final decision to destroy czechoslovakia soon and had initiated military preparations all along the line (1780-ps). by april the plan had been perfected to attack czechoslovakia ""with lightning swift action as the result of an incident"" (388-ps). all along the line preparations became more definite for a war of expansion on the assumption that it would result in a worldwide conflict. in september 1938 admiral carls officially commented on a ""draft study of naval warfare against england"": ""there is full agreement with the main theme of the study. ""1. if according to the fuhrer's decision germany is to acquire a position as a world power, she needs not only sufficient colonial possessions but also secure naval communications and secure access to the ocean. ""2. both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to anglo-french interests and will limit their positions as world powers. it is unlikely that they can be achieved by peaceful means. the decision to make germany a world power therefore forces upon us the necessity of making the corresponding preparations for war. ""3. war against england means at the same time war against the empire, against france, probably against russia as well, and a large number of countries overseas; in fact, against one-half to one-third of the whole world. ""it can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is prepared economically as well as politically and militarily and waged with the aim of conquering for germany an outlet to the ocean"" (c-23). this tribunal knows what categorical assurances were given to an alarmed world after the anschluss, after munich, after the occupation of bohemia and moravia, that german ambitions were realized and that hitler had ""no further territorial demands to make in europe."" the record of this trial shows that those promises were calculated deceptions and that those high in the bloody brotherhood of nazidom knew it. as early as 4/15/1938 goring pointed out to mussolini and ciano that the possession of those territories would make possible an attack on poland (1874-ps). ribbentrop's ministry on 8/26/1938 was writing: ""after the settlement of the czechoslovakian question, it will be generally assumed that poland will be next in turn"" (tc-76). hitler, after the polish invasion, boasted that it was the austrian and czechoslovakian triumphs by which ""the basis for the action against poland was laid"" (789-ps). goring suited the act to the purpose and gave immediate instructions to exploit for the further strengthening of the german war potential, first the sudetenland, and then the whole protectorate (r-133). by may of 1939 the nazi preparations had ripened to the point that hitler confided to the defendants goring, raeder, keitel, and others his readiness ""to attack poland at the first suitable opportunity,"" even though he recognized that ""further successes cannot be attained without the shedding of blood."" the larcenous motives behind this decision he made plain in words that echoed the covetous theme of mein kampf: ""circumstances must be adapted to aims. this is impossible without invasion of foreign states or attacks upon foreign property. living space in proportion to the magnitude of the state is the basis of all power further successes cannot be attained without expanding our living space in the east..."" (l-79). while a credulous world slumbered, snugly blanketed with perfidious assurances of peaceful intentions, the nazis prepared not as before for a war but now for the war. the defendants goring, keitel, raeder, frick, and funk, with others, met as the reich defense council in june of 1939. the minutes, authenticated by goring, are revealing evidences of the way in which each step of nazi planning dovetailed with every other. these five key defendants, 3 months before the first panzer unit had knifed into poland, were laying plans for ""employment of the population in wartime,"" and had gone so far as to classify industry for priority in labor supply after ""5 million servicemen had been called up."" they decided upon measures to avoid ""confusion when mobilization takes place,"" and declared a purpose ""to gain and maintain the lead in the decisive initial weeks of a war."" they then planned to use in production prisoners of war, criminal prisoners, and concentration camp inmates. they then decided on ""compulsory work for women in wartime."" they had already passed on applications from 1,172,000 specialist workmen for classification as indispensable, and had approved 727,000 of them. they boasted that orders to workers to report for duty ""are ready and tied up in bundles at the labor offices."" and they resolved to increase the industrial manpower supply by bringing into germany ""hundreds of thousands of workers"" from the protectorate to be ""housed together in hutments"" 3787-ps). it is the minutes of this significant conclave of many key defendants which disclose how the plan to start the war was coupled with the plan to wage the war through the use of illegal sources of labor to maintain production. hitler, in announcing his plan to attack poland, had already foreshadowed the slave-labor program as one of its corollaries when he cryptically pointed out to the defendants goring, raeder, keitel, and others that the polish population ""will be available as a source of labor"" (l-79). this was part of the plan made good by frank, who as governor general notified goring that he would supply ""at least one million male and female agricultural and industrial workers to the reich"" (1374-ps), and by sauckel, whose impressments throughout occupied territory aggregated numbers equal to the total population of some of the smaller nations of europe. here also comes to the surface the link between war labor and concentration camps, a manpower source that was increasingly used and with increasing cruelty. an agreement between himmler and the minister of justice thierack in 1942 provided for ""the delivery of antisocial elements from the execution of their sentence to the reichsfuhrer ss to be worked to death"" (654-ps). an ss directive provided that bedridden prisoners be drafted for work to be performed in bed (1395-ps). the gestapo ordered 46,000 jews arrested to increase the ""recruitment of manpower into the concentration camps"" (1472-ps). one hundred thousand jews were brought from hungary to augment the camps' manpower (r-124). on the initiative of the defendant donitz, concentration camp labor was used in the construction of submarines (c-195). concentration camps were thus geared into war production on the one hand, and into the administration of justice and the political aims of the nazis on the other. the use of prisoner-of-war labor as then planned in that meeting also grew with german needs. at a time when every german soldier was needed at the front and forces were not available at home, russian prisoners of war were forced to man anti.aircraft guns against allied planes. field marshal milch reflected the nazi merriment at this flagrant violation of international law, saying: "".   this is an amusing thing, that the russians must work the guns"" (r-124). the orders for the treatment of soviet prisoners of war were so ruthless that admiral canaris, pointing out that they would ""result in arbitrary mistreatments and killing,"" protested to the okw against them as breaches of international law. the reply of keitel was unambiguous. he said: ""the objections arise from the military conception of chivalrous warfare! this is the destruction of an ideology! therefore, i approve and back the measures"" (c-338). the geneva convention would have been thrown overboard openly except that jodl objected because he wanted the benefits of allied observance of it while it was not being allowed to hamper the germans in any way. other crimes in the conduct of warfare were planned with equal thoroughness as a means of insuring victory of german arms. in october 1938, almost a year before the start of the war, the large scale violation of the established rules of warfare was contemplated as a policy, and the supreme command circulated a ""most secret"" list of devious explanations to be given by the propaganda minister in such cases (c-2). even before this time commanders of the armed forces were instructed to employ any means of warfare so long as it facilitated victory (l-211). after the war was in progress the orders increased in savagery. a typical keitel order, demanding the use of the most brutal means,"" provided that: "".   it is the duty of the troops to use all means without restriction, even against women and children, so long as it insures success."" the german naval forces were no more immune from the infection than the land forces. raeder ordered violations of the accepted rules of warfare wherever necessary to gain strategic successes (c-157). donitz urged his submarine crews not to rescue survivors of torpedoed enemy ships in order to cripple merchant shipping of the allied nations by decimating their crews (d-642). thus, the war crimes against allied forces and the crimes against humanity committed in occupied territories are incontestably part of the program for making the war because, in the german calculations, they were indispensable to its hope of success. similarly, the whole group of prewar crimes, including the persecutions within germany, fall into place around the plan for aggressive war like stones in a finely wrought mosaic. nowhere is the whole catalog of crimes of nazi oppression and terrorism within germany so well integrated with the crime of war as in that strange mixture of wind and wisdom which makes up the testimony of hermann goring. in describing the aims of the nazi program before the seizure of power, goring said: ""the first question was to achieve and establish a different political structure for germany which would enable germany to obtain against the dictate (of versailles) not only a protest but an objection of such a nature that it would actually be considered."" with these purposes, goring admitted that the plan was made to overthrow the weimar republic to seize power, and to carry out the nazi program by whatever means were necessary, whether legal or illegal. from goring's cross-examination we learn how necessarily the whole program of crime followed. because they considered a strong state necessary to get rid of the versailles treaty, they adopted the fuhrerprinzip. having seized power, the nazis thought it necessary to protect it by abolishing parliamentary government and suppressing all organized opposition from political parties (l-83). this was reflected in the philosophy of goring that the opera was more important than the reichstag. even the ""opposition of each individual was not tolerated unless it was a matter of unimportance."" to insure the suppression of opposition a secret police force was necessary. in order to eliminate incorrigible opponents, it was necessary to establish concentration camps and to resort to the device of protective custody. protective custody, goring testified, meant that: ""people were arrested and taken into protective custody who had committed no crime but who one might expect, if they remained in freedom, would do all sorts of things to damage the german state."" the same war purpose was dominant in the persecution of the jews. in the beginning, fanaticism and political opportunism played a principal part, for anti-semitism and its allied scapegoat, mythology, was a vehicle on which the nazis rode to power. it was for this reason that the filthy streicher and the blasphemous rosenberg were welcomed at party rallies and made leaders and officials of the state or party. but the nazis soon regarded the jews as foremost among the opposition to the police state with which they planned to put forward their plans of military aggression. fear of their pacifism and their opposition to strident nationalism was given as the reason that the jews had to be driven from the political and economic life of germany. accordingly, they were transported like cattle to the concentration camps, where they were utilized as a source of forced labor for war purposes. at a meeting held on 11/12/1938, 2 days after the violent anti-jewish pogroms instigated by goebbels and carried out by the party leadership corps and the sa, the program for the elimination of jews from the german economy was mapped out by goring, funk, heydrich, goebbels, and the other top nazis. the measures adopted included confinement of the jews in ghettos, cutting off their food supply, ""aryanizing"" their shops, and restricting their freedom of movement (1816-ps). here another purpose behind the jewish persecutions crept in, for it was the wholesale confiscation of their property which helped finance german rearmament. although schacht's plan to have foreign money ransom the entire race within germany was not adopted, the jews were stripped to the point where goring was able to advise the reich defense council that the critical situation of the reich exchequer, due to rearmament, had keen relieved ""through the billion reichsmark fine imposed on jewry, and through profits accrued to the reich in the aryanization of jewish enterprises"" (3575-ps). a glance over the dock will show that, despite quarrels among themselves, each defendant played a part which fitted in with every other, and that all advanced the common plan. it contradicts experience that men of such diverse backgrounds and talents should so forward each other's aims by coincidence. the large and varied role of goring was half militarist and half gangster. he stuck his pudgy finger in every pie. he used his sa musclemen to help bring the gang into power. in order to entrench that power he contrived to have the reichstag burned, established the gestapo, and created the concentration camps. he was equally adept at massacring opponents and at framing scandals to get rid of stubborn generals. he built up the luftwaffe and hurled it at his defenseless neighbors. he was among the foremost in harrying jews out of the land. by mobilizing the total economic resources of germany he made possible the waging of the war which he had taken a large part in planning. he was, next to hitler, the man who tied the activities of all the defendants together in a common effort. the parts played by the other defendants, although less comprehensive and less spectacular than that of the reichsmarshal, were nevertheless integral and necessary contributions to the joint undertaking, without any one of which the success of the common enterprise would have been in jeopardy. there are many specific deeds of which these men have been proven guilty. no purpose would be served nor indeed is time available to review all the crimes which the evidence has charged up to their names. nevertheless, in viewing the conspiracy as a whole and as an operating mechanism, it may be well to recall briefly the outstanding services which each of the men in the dock rendered to the common cause. the president: would that be a convenient time to adjourn? mr. justice jackson: entirely, your honor. the zealot hess, before succumbing to wanderlust, was the engineer tending the party machinery, passing orders and propaganda down to the leadership corps, supervising every aspect of party activities, and maintaining the organization as a loyal and' ready instrument of power. when apprehensions abroad threatened the success of the nazi regime for conquest, it was the duplicitous ribbentrop, the salesman of deception, who was detailed to pour wine on the troubled waters of suspicion by preaching the gospel of limited and peaceful intentions. keitel, the weak and willing tool, delivered the armed forces, the instrument of aggression, over to the party and directed them in executing its felonious designs. kaltenbrunner, the grand inquisitor, took up the bloody mantle of heydrich to stifle opposition and terrorize compliance, and buttressed the power of national socialism on a foundation of guiltless corpses. it was rosenberg, the intellectual high priest of the ""master race,"" who provided the doctrine of hatred which gave the impetus for the annihilation of jewry, and who put his infidel theories into practice against the eastern occupied territories. his woolly philosophy also added boredom to the long list of nazi atrocities. the fanatical frank, who solidified nazi control by establishing the new order of authority without law, so that the will of the party was the only test of legality, proceeded to export his lawlessness to poland, which he governed with the lash of caesar and whose population he reduced to sorrowing remnants. frick, the ruthless organizer, helped the party to seize power, supervised the police agencies to insure that it stayed in power, and chained the economy of bohemia and moravia to the german war machine. streicher, the venomous vulgarian, manufactured and distributed obscene racial libels which incited the populace to accept and assist the progressively savage operations of ""race purification."" as minister of economics funk accelerated the pace of rearmament and as reichsbank president banked for the ss the gold teeth fillings of concentration camp victims probably the most ghoulish collateral in banking history. it was schacht, the facade of starched respectability, who in the early days provided the window dressing, the bait for the hesitant, and whose wizardry later made it possible for hitler to finance the colossal rearmament program, and to do it secretly. donitz, hitler's legatee of defeat, promoted the success of the nazi aggressions by instructing his pack of submarine killers to conduct warfare at sea with the illegal ferocity of the jungle. raeder, the political admiral, stealthily built up the german navy in defiance of the versailles treaty, and then put it to use in a series of aggressions which he had taken a leading part in planning. von schirach, poisoner of a generation, initiated the german youth in nazi doctrine, trained them in legions for service in the ss and wehrmacht, and delivered them up to the party as fanatic, unquestioning executors of its will. sauckel, the greatest and cruelest slaver since the pharaohs of egypt, produced desperately needed manpower by driving foreign peoples into the land of bondage on a scale unknown even in the ancient days of tyranny in the kingdom of the nile. jodl, betrayer of the traditions of his profession, led the wehrmacht in violating its own code of military honor in order to carry out the barbarous aims of nazi policy. von papen, pious agent of an infidel regime, held the stirrup while hitler vaulted into the saddle, lubricated the austrian annexation, and devoted his diplomatic cunning to the service of nazi objectives abroad. seyss-inquart, spearhead of the austrian fifth column, took over the government of his own country only to make a present of it to hitler, and then, moving north, brought terror and oppression to the netherlands and pillaged its economy for the benefit of the german juggernaut. von neurath, the old-school diplomat, who cast the pearls of his experience before nazis, guided nazi diplomacy in the early years, soothed the fears of prospective victims, and, as reich protector of bohemia and moravia, strengthened the german position for the coming attack on poland. speer, as minister of armaments and production, joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into german war industries, which waxed in output while the laborers waned in starvation. fritzsche, radio propaganda chief, by manipulation of the truth goaded german public opinion into frenzied support of the regime and anesthetized the independent judgment of the population so that they did without question their masters' bidding. and bormann, who has not accepted our invitation to this reunion, sat at the throttle of the vast and powerful engine of the party, guiding it in the ruthless execution of nazi policies, from the scourging of the christian church to the lynching of captive allied airmen. the activities of all these defendants, despite their varied backgrounds and talents, were joined with the efforts of other conspirators not now in the dock, who played still other essential roles. they blend together into one consistent and militant pattern animated by a common objective to reshape the map of europe by force of arms. some of these defendants were ardent members of the nazi movement from its birth. others, less fanatical, joined the common enterprise later, after success had made participation attractive by the promise of rewards. this group of latter-day converts remedied a crucial defect in the ranks of the original true believers, for as dr. siemers has pointed out in his summation: "".  .there were no specialists among the national socialists for the particular tasks. most of the national socialist collaborators did not previously follow a trade requiring technical education."" it was the fatal weakness of the early nazi band that it lacked technical competence. it could not from among its own ranks make up a government capable of carrying out all the projects necessary to realize its aims. therein lies the special crime and betrayal of men like schacht and von neurath, speer and von papen, raeder and donitz, keitel and jodl. it is doubtful whether the nazi master plan could have succeeded without their specialized intelligence which they so willingly put at its command. they did so with knowledge of its announced aims and methods, and continued their services after practice had confirmed the direction in which they were tending. their superiority to the average run of nazi mediocrity is not their excuse. it is their condemnation. the dominant fact which stands out from all the thousands of pages of the record of this trial is that the central crime of the whole group of nazi crimes the attack on the peace of the world was clearly and deliberately planned. the beginning of these wars of aggression was not an unprepared and spontaneous springing to arms by a population excited by some current indignation. a week before the invasion of poland hitler told his military commanders: ""i shall give a propagandist cause for starting war never mind whether it be plausible or not. the victor shall not be asked later on whether we told the truth or not. in starting and making a war, it is not the right that matters, but victory (1014-ps). the propagandist incident was duly provided by dressing concentration camp inmates in polish uniforms, in order to create the appearance of a polish attack on a german frontier radio station (2751-ps). the plan to occupy belgium, holland, and luxembourg first appeared as early as august 1938 in connection with the plan for attack on czechoslovakia (375-ps). the intention to attack became a program in may 1939, when hitler told his commanders that ""the dutch and belgian air bases must be occupied by armed forces. declarations of neutrality must be ignored"" (l-79). thus, the follow-up wars were planned before the first was launched. these were the most carefully plotted wars in all history. scarcely a step in their terrifying succession and progress failed to move according to the master blueprint or the subsidiary schedules and timetables until long after the crimes of aggression were consummated. nor were the war crimes and the crimes against humanity unplanned, isolated, or spontaneous offenses. aside from our undeniable evidence of their plotting, it is sufficient to ask whether 6 million people could be separated from the population of several nations on the basis of their blood and birth, could be destroyed and their bodies disposed of, except that the operation fitted into the general scheme of government. could the enslavement of 5 millions of laborers, their impressment into service, their transportation to germany, their allocation to work where they would be most useful, their maintenance, if slow starvation can be called maintenance, and their guarding have been accomplished if it did not fit into the common plan? could hundreds of concentration camps located throughout germany, built to accommodate hundreds of thousands of victims, and each requiring labor and materials for construction, manpower to operate and supervise, and close gearing into the economy could such efforts have been expended under german autocracy if they had not suited the plan? has the teutonic passion for organization suddenly become famous for its toleration of nonconforming activity? each part of the plan fitted into every other. the slave-labor program meshed with the needs of industry and agriculture, and these in turn synchronized with the military machine. the elaborate propaganda apparatus geared with the program to dominate the people and incite them to a war their sons would have to fight. the armament industries were fed by the concentration camps. the concentration camps were fed by the gestapo. the gestapo was fed by the spy system of the nazi party. nothing was permitted under the nazi iron rule that was not in accordance with the program. everything of consequence that took place in this regimented society was but a manifestation of a premeditated and unfolding purpose to secure the nazi state a place in the sun by casting all others into darkness. the defendants meet this overwhelming case, some by admitting a limited responsibility, some by putting the blame on others, and some by taking the position in effect that while there have been enormous crimes there are no criminals. time will not permit me to examine each individual and particular defense, but there are certain lines of defense common to so many cases that they deserve some consideration. counsel for many of the defendants seek to dismiss the conspiracy or common planning charge on the ground that the pattern of the nazi plan does not fit into the concept of conspiracy applicable in german law to the plotting of a highway robbery or a burglary. their concept of conspiracy is in the terms of a stealthy meeting in the dead of night, in a secluded hideout, in which a small group of felons plot every detail of a specific crime. the charter forestalls resort to such parochial and narrow concepts of conspiracy taken from local law by using the additional and nontechnical term, ""common plan."" omitting entirely the alternative term of ""conspiracy,"" the charter reads that ""leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan to commit any of the described crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan."" the charter concept of a common plan really represents the conspiracy principle in an international context. a common plan or conspiracy to seize the machinery of a state, to commit crimes against the peace of the world, to blot a race out of existence, to enslave millions, and to subjugate and loot whole nations cannot be thought of in the same terms as the plotting of petty crimes, although the same underlying principles are applicable. little gangsters may plan which will carry a pistol and which a stiletto, who will approach a victim from the front and who from behind, and where they will waylay him. but in planning a war, the pistol becomes a wehrmacht, the stiletto, a luftwaffe. where to strike is not a choice of dark alleys, but a matter of world geography. the operation involves the manipulation of public opinion, the law of the state, the police power, industry, and finance. the baits and bluffs must be translated into a nation's foreign policy. likewise the degree of stealth which points to a guilty purpose in a conspiracy will depend upon its object. the clandestine preparations of a state against international society, although camouflaged to those abroad, might be quite open and notorious among its own people. but stealth is not an essential ingredient of such planning. parts of the common plan may be proclaimed from the housetops, as anti-semitism was, and parts of it kept under cover s rearmament for a long time was. it is a matter of strategy how much of the preparation shall be made public, as was goring's announcement in 1935 of the creation of an air force, and how much shall be kept covert, as in the case of the nazis' use of shovels to teach ""labor corps"" the manual of arms (3054-ps). the forms of this grand type of conspiracy are amorphous, the means are opportunistic, and neither can divert the law from getting at the substance of things. the defendants contend, however, that there could be no conspiracy involving aggressive war because: (1) none of the nazis wanted war; (2) rearmament was only intended to provide the strength to make germany's voice heard in the family of nations and (3) the wars were not in fact aggressive wars but were defensive against a ""bolshevik menace."" when we analyze the argument that the nazis did not want war it comes down, in substance, to this: ""the record looks bad indeed objectively but when you consider the state of my mind subjectively i hated war. i knew the horrors of war. i wanted peace."" i am not so sure of this. i am even less willing to accept goring's description of the general staff as pacifist. however, it will not injure our case to admit that as an abstract proposition none of these defendants liked war. but they wanted things which they knew they could not get without war. they wanted their neighbors' lands and goods. their philosophy seems to be that if the neighbors would not acquiesce, then they are the aggressors and are to blame for the war. the fact is, however, that war never became terrible to the nazis until it came home to them, until it exposed their deceptive assurances to the german people that german cities, like the ruined one in which we meet, would be invulnerable. from then on, war was terrible. but again the defendants claim, ""to be sure, we were building guns. but not to shoot. they were only to give us weight in negotiating."" at its best this argument amounts to a contention that the military forces were intended for blackmail, not for battle. the threat of military invasion which forced the austrian anschluss, the threats which preceded munich, and goring's threat to bomb the beautiful city of prague if the president of czechoslovakia did not consent to a protectorate, are examples of what the defendants have in mind when they talk of arming to back negotiation. but from the very nature of german demands, the day was bound to come when some country would refuse to buy its peace, would refuse to pay danegelt, ""for the end of that game is oppression and shame, and the nation that plays it is lost."" did these defendants then intend to withdraw german demands, or was germany to enforce them and manipulate propaganda so as to place the blame for the war on the nation so unreasonable as to resist? events have answered that question, and documents such as admiral carl's memorandum, earlier quoted, leave no doubt that the events occurred as anticipated. but some of the defendants argue that the wars were not aggressive and were only intended to protect germany against some eventual danger from the ""menace of communism,"" which was something of an obsession with many nazis. at the outset this argument of self-defense falls because it completely ignores this damning combination of facts clearly established in the record: first, the enormous and rapid german preparations for war; second, the repeatedly avowed intentions of the german leaders to attack, which i have previously cited; and third, the fact that a series of wars occurred in which german forces struck the first blows, without warning, across the borders of other nations. even if it could be shown which it cannot that the russian war was really defensive, such is demonstrably not the case with those wars which preceded it. it may also be pointed out that even those who would have you believe that germany was menaced by communism also compete with each other in describing their opposition to the disastrous russian venture. is it reasonable that they would have opposed that war if it were undertaken in good-faith self-defense? the frivolous character of the self-defense theory on the facts it is sought to compensate, as advocates often do, by resort to a theory of law. dr. jahrreiss, in his scholarly argument for the defense, rightly points out that no treaty provision and no principle of law denied germany, as a sovereign nation, the right of self-defense. he follows with the assertion for which there is authority in classic international law, that "".   every state is alone judge of whether in a given case it is waging a war of self-defense."" it is not necessary to examine the validity of an abstract principle which does not apply to the facts of our case. i do not doubt that if a nation arrived at a judgment that it must resort to war in self-defense, because of conditions affording reasonable grounds for such an honest judgment, any tribunal would accord it great and perhaps conclusive weight, even if later events proved that judgment mistaken. but the facts in this case call for no such deference to honest judgment because no such judgment was ever pretended much less honestly made. in all the documents which disclose the planning and rationalization of these attacks, not one sentence has been or can be cited to show a good-faith fear of attack. it may be that statesmen of other nations lacked the courage forthrightly and fully to disarm. perhaps they suspected the secret rearmament of germany. but if they hesitated to abandon arms, they did not hesitate to neglect them. germany well knew that her former enemies had allowed their armaments to fall into decay, so little did they contemplate another war. germany faced a europe that not only was unwilling to attack, but was too weak and pacifist even adequately to defend, and went to the very verge of dishonor, if not beyond, to buy its peace. the minutes we have shown you of the nazis' secret conclaves identify no potential attacker. they bristle with the spirit of aggression and not of defense. they contemplate always territorial expansion, not the maintenance of territorial integrity. minister of war von blomberg, in his 1937 directive prescribing general principles for the preparation for war of the armed forces has given the lie to these feeble claims of self-defense. he stated at that time: ""the general political situation justifies the supposition that germany need not consider an attack on any side. grounds for this are, in addition to the lack of desire for war in almost all nations, particularly the western powers, the deficiencies in the preparedness for war in a number of states and of russia in particular."" nevertheless, he recommended: "".   a continuous preparation for war in order to (a) counterattack at any time, and (b) to enable the military exploitation of politically favorable opportunities should they occur"" if these defendants may now cynically plead self-defense, although no good-faith need of self-defense was asserted or contemplated by any responsible leader at that time, it reduces nonaggression treaties to a legal absurdity. they become additional instruments of deception in the hands of the aggressor, and traps for well-meaning nations. if there be in nonaggression pacts an implied condition that each nation may make a bona fide judgment as to the necessity for self-defense against imminent threatened attack, it certainly cannot be invoked to shelter those who never made any such judgment at all. in opening this case i ventured to predict that there would be no serious denial that the crimes charged were committed, and that the issue would concern the responsibility of particular defendants. the defendants have fulfilled that prophecy. generally, they do not deny that these things happened, but it is contended that they ""just happened,"" and that they were not the result of a common plan or conspiracy. one of the chief reasons the defendants say there was no conspiracy is the argument that conspiracy was impossible with a dictator. the argument runs that they all had to obey hitler's orders, which had the force of law in the german state, and hence obedience could not be made the basis of an original charge. in this way it is explained that while there have been wholesale killings, there have been no murderers. this argument is an effort to evade article 8 of the charter, which provides that the order of the government or of a superior shall not free a defendant from responsibility but can only be considered in mitigation. this provision of the charter corresponds with the justice and with the realities of the situation, as indicated in defendant speer's description of what he considered to be the common responsibility of the leaders of the german nation: "".   with reference to utterly decisive matters, there is total responsibility. there must be total responsibility insofar as a person is one of the leaders, because who else could assume responsibility for the development of events, if not the immediate associates who work with and around the head of the state?"" again he told the tribunal: "".   it is impossible after the catastrophe to evade this total responsibility. if the war had been won, the leaders would also have assumed total responsibility."" like much of defense counsel's abstract arguments, the contention that the absolute power of hitler precluded a conspiracy crumbles in the face of the facts of record. the fuhrerprinzip of absolutism was itself a part of the common plan, as goring has pointed out. the defendants may have become the slaves of a dictator, but he was their dictator. to make him such was, as goring has testified, the object of the nazi movement from the beginning. every nazi took this oath: ""i pledge eternal allegiance to adolf hitler. i pledge unconditional obedience to him and the fuhrers appointed by him"" 1893-ps). moreover, they forced everybody else in their power to take it this oath was illegal under german law, which made it criminal to become a member of an organization in which obedience to ""unknown superiors or unconditional obedience to known superiors is pledged."" these men destroyed free government in germany and now plead to be excused from responsibility because they became slaves. they are in the position of the fictional boy who murdered his father and mother and then pleaded for leniency because he was n orphan. what these men have overlooked is that adolf hitler's acts are their acts. it was these men among millions of others, and it was these men leading millions of others, who built up adolf hitler and vested in his psychopathic personality not only innumerable lesser decisions but the supreme issue of war or peace. they intoxicated him with power and adulation. they fed his hates and aroused his fears. they put a loaded gun in his eager hands. it was left to hitler to pull the trigger, and when he did they all at that time approved. his guilt stands admitted, by some defendants reluctantly, by some vindictively. but his guilt is the- guilt of the whole dock, and of every man in it. but it is urged that these defendants could not be in agreement on a common plan or in a conspiracy because they were fighting among themselves or belonged to different factions or cliques. of course, it is not necessary that men should agree on everything in order to agree on enough things to make them liable for a criminal conspiracy. unquestionably there were conspiracies within the conspiracy, and intrigues and rivalries and battles for power schacht and goring disagreed, but over which of them should control the economy, not over whether the economy should be regimented for war. goring claims to have departed from the plan because through dahlerus he conducted some negotiations with men of influence in england just before the polish war. but it is perfectly clear that this was not an effort to prevent aggression against poland but to make that aggression successful and safe by obtaining english neutrality (tc-90). rosenberg and goring may have had some differences as to how stolen art should be distributed but they had none about how it should be stolen. jodl and goring may have disagreed about whether to denounce the geneva convention, but they have never disagreed about violating it. and so it goes through the whole long and sordid story. nowhere do we find a single instance where any one of the defendants stood up against the rest and said: ""this thing is wrong and i will not go along with it."" wherever they differed, their differences were as to method or disputes over jurisdiction, but always within the framework of the common plan. some of the defendants also contend that in any. event there was no conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity because cabinet members never met with the military to plan these acts. but these crimes were only the inevitable and incidental results of the plan to commit the aggression for lebensraum purposes. hitler stated, at a conference with his commanders, that: ""the main objective in poland is the destruction of the enemy and not the reaching of a certain geographical line"" (1014-ps). frank picked up the tune and suggested that when their usefulness was exhausted, "".   then, for all i care, mincemeat can be made of the poles and ukrainians and all the others who run around heretic does not matter what happens"" (2233-ps). reichskommissar koch in the ukraine echoed the refrain: ""i will draw the very last out of this country. i did not come to spread bliss..."" (1130-ps). this was lebensraum on its seamy side. could men of their practical intelligence expect to get neighboring lands free from the claims of their tenants without committing crimes against humanity? the last stand of each defendant is that even if there was a conspiracy, he was not in it. it is therefore important in examining their attempts at avoidance of responsibility to know, first of all, just what it is that a conspiracy charge comprehends and punishes in conspiracy we do not punish one man for another man's crime. we seek to punish each for his own crime of joining a common criminal plan in which others also participated. the measure of the criminality of the plan and therefore of the guilt of each participant is, of course, the sum total of crimes committed by all in executing the plan. but the gist of the offense is participation in the formulation or execution of the plan. these are rules which every society has found necessary in order to reach men, like these defendants, who never get blood on their own hands but who lay plans that result in the shedding of blood. all over germany today, in every zone of occupation, little men who carried out these criminal policies under orders are being convicted and punished. it would present a vast and unforgivable caricature of justice if the men who planned these policies and directed these little men should escape all penalty. these men in this dock, on the face of this record, were not strangers to this program of crime, nor was their connection with it remote or obscure. we find them in the very heart of it. the positions they held show that we have chosen defendants of self evident responsibility. they are the very top surviving authorities in their respective fields and in the nazi state. no one lives who, at least until the very last moments of the war, outranked goring in position, power, and influence. no soldier stood above keitel and jodl, and no sailor above raeder and donitz. who can be responsible for the diplomacy of duplicity if not the foreign ministers, von neurath and ribbentrop, and the diplomatic handy man von papen? who should be answerable for the oppressive administration of occupied countries if gauleiters, protectors, governors and kommissars such as frank, seyss-inquart, frick, von schirach, von neurath, and rosenberg are not? where shall we look for those who mobilized the economy for total war if we overlook schacht and speer and funk? who was the master of the great slaving enterprise if it was not sauckel? where shall we find the hand that ran the concentration camps if it was not the hand of kaltenbrunner? and who whipped up the hates and fears of the public, and manipulated the party organizations to incite these crimes, if not hess, von schirach, fritzsche, bormann, and the unspeakable julius streicher? the list of defendants is made up of men who played indispensable and reciprocal parts in this tragedy. the photographs and the films show them again and again together on important occasions. the documents show them agreed on policies and on methods, and all working aggressively for the expansion of germany by force. each of these men made a real contribution to the nazi plan. each man had a key part. deprive the nazi regime of the functions performed by a schacht, a sauckel, a von papen, or a goring and you have a different regime. look down the rows of fallen men and picture them as the photographic and documentary evidence shows them to have been in their days of power. is there one who did not substantially advance the conspiracy along its bloody path toward its bloody goal? can we assume that the great effort of these men's lives was directed toward ends they never suspected? to escape the implications of their positions and the inference of guilt from their activities, the defendants are almost unanimous in one defense. the refrain is heard time and again: these men were without authority, without knowledge, without influence without importance. funk summed up the general self-abasement of the dock in his plaintive lament that: ""i always, so to speak, came up to the door, but i was not permitted to enter."" in the testimony of each defendant, at some point there was reached the familiar blank wall: nobody knew anything about what was going on. time after time we have heard the chorus from the dock: ""i only heard about these things here for the first time."" these men saw no evil, spoke none, and none was uttered in their presence. this claim might sound very plausible if made by one defendant. but when we put all their stories together, the impression which emerges of the third reich, which was to last a thousand years, is ludicrous. if we combine only the stories of the front bench, this is the ridiculous composite picture of hitler's government that emerges. it was composed of: a number 2 man who knew nothing of the excesses of the gestapo which he created, and never suspected the jewish extermination program although he was the signer of over a score of decrees which instituted the persecutions of that race; a number 3 man who was merely an innocent middleman transmitting hitler's orders without even reading them, like a postman or delivery boy; a foreign minister who knew little of foreign affairs and nothing of foreign policy; a field marshal who issued orders to the armed forces but had no idea of the results they would have in practice; a security chief who was of the impression that the policing functions of his gestapo and sd were somewhat on the order of directing traffic; a party philosopher who was interested in historical research and had no idea of the violence which his philosophy was inciting in the twentieth century; a governor general of poland who reigned but did not rule; a gauleiter of franconia whose occupation was to pour forth filthy writings about the jews, but who had no idea that anybody would read them; a minister of interior who knew not even what went on in the interior of his own office, much less the interior of his own department, and nothing at all about the interior of germany; a reichsbank president who was totally ignorant of what went in and out of the vaults of his bank; and a plenipotentiary for the war economy who secretly marshaled the entire economy for armament, but had no idea it had anything to do with war. this may seem like a fantastic exaggeration, but this is what you would actually be obliged to conclude if you were to acquit these defendants. they do protest too much. they deny knowing what was common knowledge. they deny knowing plans and programs that were as public as mein kampf and the party program. they deny even knowing the contents of documents they received and acted upon. nearly all the defendants take two or more conflicting positions. let us illustrate the inconsistencies of their positions by the record of one defendant who, if pressed, would himself concede that he is the most intelligent, honorable, and innocent man in the dock. that is schacht. and this is the effect of his own testimony but let us not forget that i recite it not against him alone, but because most of its self-contradictions are found in the testimony of several defendants: schacht did not openly join the nazi movement until it had won, nor openly desert it until it had lost. he admits that he never gave it public opposition, but asserts that he never gave it private loyalty. when we demand of him why he did not stop the criminal course of the regime in which he was a minister, he says he had not a bit of influence. when we ask why he remained a member of the criminal regime, he tells us that by sticking on he expected to moderate its program. like a brahmin among untouchables, he could not bear to mingle with the nazi socially, but never could he afford to separate from them politically. of all the nazi aggressions by which he now claims to have been shocked there is not one that he did not support before the world with the weight of his name and prestige. having armed hitler to blackmail a continent, his answer now is to blame england and france for yielding. schacht always fought for his position in a regime he now affects to despise. he sometimes disagreed with his nazi confederates about what was expedient in reaching their goal, but he never dissented from the goal itself. when he did break with, them in the twilight of the regime, it was over tactics, not principles. from then on he never ceased to urge others to risk their positions and their necks to forward his plots, but never on any occasion did he hazard either of his own. he now boasts that he personally would have shot hitler if he had had the opportunity, but the german newsreel shows that even after the fall of france, when he faced the living hitler, he stepped out of line to grasp the hand he now claims to loathe and hung upon the words of the man he now says he thought unworthy of belief. schacht says he steadily ""sabotaged"" the hitler government. yet the most relentless secret service in the world never detected him doing the regime any harm until long after he knew the war to be lost and the nazis doomed. schacht, who dealt in hedges all his life, always kept himself in a position to claim that he was in either camp. the plea for him is as specious on analysis as it is persuasive on first sight. schacht represents the most dangerous and reprehensible type of opportunism that of the man of influential position who is ready to join a movement that he knows to be wrong because he thinks it is winning. these defendants, unable to deny that they were the men in the very top ranks of power, and unable to deny that the crimes i have outlined actually happened, know that their own denials are incredible unless they can suggest someone who is guilty. the defendants have been unanimous, when pressed, in shifting the blame on other men, sometimes on one and sometimes on another. but the names they have repeatedly picked are hitler, himmler, heydrich, goebbels, and bormann. all of these are dead or missing. no matter how hard we have pressed the defendants on. the stand, they have never pointed the finger at a living man as guilty. it is a temptation to ponder the wondrous workings of a fate which has left only the guilty dead and only the innocent alive. it is almost too remarkable. the chief villain on whom blame is placed some of the defendants vie with each other in producing appropriate epithets is hitler. he is the man at whom nearly every defendant has pointed an accusing finger. i shall not dissent from this consensus, nor do i deny that all these dead and missing men shared the guilt. in crimes so reprehensible that degrees of guilt have lost their significance they may have played the most evil parts. but their guilt cannot exculpate the defendants. hitler did not carry all responsibility to the grave with him. all the guilt is not wrapped in himmler's shroud. it was these dead men whom these living chose to be their partners in this great conspiratorial brotherhood, and the crimes that they did together they must pay for one by one. it may well be said that hitler's final crime was against the land he had ruled. he was a mad messiah who started the war without cause and prolonged it without reason. if he could not rule he cared not what happened to germany. as fritzsche has told us from the stand, hitler tried to use the defeat of germany for the self-destruction of the german people. he continued to fight when he knew it could not be won, and continuance meant only ruin. speer, in this courtroom, has described it as follows:     the sacrifices which were made on both sides after january 1945 were without sense. the dead of this period will be the accusers of the man responsible for the continuation of that fight, adolf hitler, just as much as the destroyed cities, destroyed in that last phase, who had lost tremendous cultural values and tremendous numbers of dwellings.... the german people he said remained faithful to adolf hitler until the end. he has betrayed them knowingly. he has tried to throw them into the abyss.  ."" hitler ordered everyone else to fight to the last and then retreated into death by his own hand. but he left life as he lived it, a deceiver; he left the official report that he had died in battle. this was the man whom these defendants exalted to a fuhrer. it was they who conspired to get him absolute authority over all of germany. and in the end he and the system they created for him brought the ruin of them all. as stated by speer on cross-examination: "".   the tremendous danger, however, contained in this totalitarian system only became abundantly clear at the moment when we were approaching the end. it was then that one could see what the meaning of the principle was, namely, that every order should be carried out without any criticism. everything    you have seen in the way of orders which were carried out without any consideration, did after all turn out to be mistakes    this system let me put it like this to the end of the system it had become clear what tremendous dangers are contained in any such system, as such quite apart from hitler's principle. the combination of hitler and this system, then, brought about this tremendous catastrophe to this world."" but let me for a moment turn devil's advocate. i admit that hitler was the chief villain. but for the defendants to put all blame on him is neither manly nor true. we know that even the head of the state has the same limits to his senses and to the hours of his days as do lesser men. he must rely on others to be his eyes and ears as to most that goes on in a great empire. other legs must run his errands; other hands must execute his plans. on whom did hitler rely for such things more than upon these men in the dock? who led him to believe he had an invincible air armada if not goring? who kept disagreeable facts from him? did not goring forbid field marshal milch to warn hitler that in his opinion germany was not equal to the war upon russia? did not goring, according to speer, relieve general galland of his air force command for speaking of the weaknesses and bungling of the air forces? who led hitler, utterly untraveled himself, to believe in the indecision and timidity of democratic peoples if not ribbentrop, von neurath, and von papen? who fed his illusion of german invincibility if not keitel, jodl, raeder, and donitz? who kept his hatred of the jews inflamed more than streicher and rosenberg? who would hitler say deceived him about conditions in concentration camps if not kaltenbrunner, even as he would deceive us? these men had access to hitler and often could control the information that reached him and on which he must base his policy and his orders. they were the praetorian guard, and while they were under caesar's orders, caesar was always in their hands. if these dead men could take the witness stand and answer what has been said against them, we might have a less distorted picture of the parts played by these defendants. imagine the stir that would occur in the dock if it should behold adolf hitler advancing to the witness box, or himmler with an armful of dossiers, or goebbels, or bormann with the reports of his party spies, or the murdered rohm or canaris. the ghoulish defense that the world is entitled to retribution only from the cadavers is an argument worthy of the crimes at which it is directed. we have presented to this tribunal an affirmative case based on incriminating documents which are sufficient, if unexplained, to require a finding of guilt on count one against each defendant. in the final analysis, the only question is whether the defendant's own testimony is to be credited as against the documents and other evidence of their guilt. what, then, is their testimony worth? the fact is that the nazi habit of economizing in the use of truth pulls the foundations out from under their own defenses. lying -has always been a highly approved nazi technique. hitler, in mein kampf, advocated mendacity as a policy. von ribbentrop admits the use of the ""diplomatic lie."" keitel advised that the facts of rearmament be kept secret so that they could be denied at geneva (ec-177). raeder deceived about rebuilding the german navy in violation of versailles. goring urged ribbentrop to tell a ""legal lie"" to the british foreign office about the anschluss, and in so doing only marshaled him the way he was going (2947-ps). goring gave his word of honor to the czechs and proceeded to break it (tc-27). even speer proposed to deceive the french into revealing the specially trained among their prisoners (r-124). nor is the lie direct the only means of falsehood. they all speak with a nazi double talk with which to deceive the unwary. in the nazi dictionary of sardonic euphemisms ""final solution"" of the jewish problem was a phrase which meant extermination ""special treatment"" of prisoners of war meant killing; ""protective custody"" meant concentration camp; ""duty labor"" meant slave labor; and an order to ""take a firm attitude"" or ""take positive measures"" meant to act with unrestrained savagery. before we accept their word at what seems to be its face, we must always look for hidden meanings. goring assured us, on his oath, that the reich defense council never met ""as such."" when we produced the stenographic minutes of a meeting at which he presided and did most of the talking, he reminded us of the ""as such"" and explained this was not a meeting of the council ""as such"" because other persons were present. goring denies ""threatening"" czechoslovakia; he only told president hacha that he would ""hate to bomb the beautiful city of prague."" besides outright false statements and double talk, there are also other circumventions of truth in the nature of fantastic explanations and absurd professions. streicher has solemnly maintained that his only thought with respect to the jews was to resettle them on the island of madagascar. his reason for destroying synagogues he blandly said, was only because they were architecturally offensive. rosenberg was stated by his counsel to have always had in mind a ""chivalrous solution"" to the jewish problem. when it was necessary to remove schuschnigg after the anschluss, ribbentrop would have had us believe that the austrian chancellor was resting at a ""villa."" it was left to cross-examination to reveal that the ""villa"" was buchenwald concentration camp. the record is full of other examples of dissimulations and evasions. even schacht showed that he, too, had adopted the nazi attitude that truth is any story which succeeds. confronted on cross-examination with a long record of broken vows and false words, he declared in justification and i quote from the record: ""i think you can score many more successes when you want to lead someone if you don't tell them the truth than if you tell them the truth."" this was the philosophy of the national socialists. when for years they have deceived the world, and masked falsehood with plausibilities, can anyone be surprised that they continue their habits of a lifetime in this dock? credibility is one of the main issues of this trial. only those who have failed to learn the bitter lessons of the last decade can doubt that men who have always played on the unsuspecting credulity of generous opponents would not hesitate to do the same, now. it is against such a background that these defendants now ask this tribunal to say that they are not guilty of planning, executing, or conspiring to commit this long list of crimes and wrongs. they stand before the record of this trial as bloodstained gloucester stood by the body of his slain king. he begged of the widow, as they beg of you: ""say i slew them not."" and the queen replied, ""then say they were not slain. but dead they are..."" if you were to say of these men that they are not guilty, it would be as true to say that there has been no war, there are no slain, there has been no crime.embed"

4,"justice scalia, delivered the opinion of the court. in 1986, petitioner david h. lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on the isle of palms in charleston county,south carolina, on which he intended to build single-family homes. in 1988, however, the south carolina legislature enacted the beachfront management act, s. c. code ann.  48-39-250 et seq. (supp. 1990), which had the direct effect of barring petitioner from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his two parcels. see  48-39-290(a). a state trial court found that this prohibition rendered lucas's parcels ""valueless."" app. to pet. for cert. 37. this case requires us to decide whether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of lucas's lots accomplished a taking of private property under the fifth and fourteenth amendments requiring the payment of ""just compensation."" u. s. const., amdt. 5.iasouth carolina's expressed interest in intensively managing development activities in the so-called ""coastal zone"" dates from 1977 when, in the aftermath of congress's passage of the federal coastal zone management act of 1972, 86 stat. 1280, as amended, 16 u. s. c.  1451 et seq., the legislature enacted a coastal zone management act of its own. see s. c. code ann.  48-39-10 et seq. (1987). in its original form, the south carolina act required owners of coastal zone land that qualified as a ""critical area"" (defined in the legislation to include beaches and immediately adjacent sand dunes,  48-39-10(j)) to obtain a permit from the newly created south carolina coastal council (council) (respondent here) prior to committing the land to a ""use other than the use the critical area was devoted to on .""  48-39-130(a). in the late 1970's, lucas and others began extensive residential development of the isle of palms, a barrier island situated eastward of the city of charleston. toward the close of the development cycle for one residential subdivision known as ""beachwood east,"" lucas in 1986 purchased the two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. no portion of the lots, which were located approximately 300 feet from the beach, qualified as a ""critical area"" under the 1977 act; accordingly, at the time lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from the council in advance of any development activity. his intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of the immediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect singlefamily residences. he commissioned architectural drawings for this purpose. the beachfront management act brought lucas's plans to an abrupt end. under that 1988 legislation, the council was directed to establish a ""baseline"" connecting the landwardmost ""point of erosion    during the past forty years"" in the region of the isle of palms that includes lucas's lots. s. c. code ann.  48-39-280(a)(2) (supp. 1988). in action not challenged here, the council fixed this baseline landward of lucas's parcels. that was significant, for under the act construction of occupable improvements lucas promptly filed suit in the south carolina court of common pleas, contending that the beachfront management act's construction bar effected a taking of his property without just compensation. lucas did not take issue with the validity of the act as a lawful exercise of south carolina's police power, but contended that the act's complete extinguishment of his property's value entitled him to compensation regardless of whether the legislature had acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives. following a bench trial, the court agreed. among its factual determinations was the finding that ""at the time lucas purchased the two lots, both were zoned for single-family residential construction and    there were no restrictions imposed upon such use of the property by either the state of south carolina, the county of charleston, or the town of the isle of palms."" app. to pet. for cert. 36. the trial court further found that the beachfront management act decreed a permanent ban on construction insofar as lucas's lots were concerned, and that this prohibition ""deprive lucas of any reasonable economic use of the lots,    eliminated the unrestricted right of use, and render them valueless."" id., at 37. the court thus concluded that lucas's properties had been ""taken"" by operation of the act, and it ordered respondent to pay ""just compensation"" in the amount of $1,232,387.50. id., at 40. the supreme court of south carolina reversed. it found dispositive what it described as lucas's concession ""that the beachfront management act properly and validly designed to preserve    south carolina's beaches."" 304 s. c. 376, 379, 404 s. e. 2d 895, 896 (1991). failing an attack on the validity of the statute as such, the court believed itself bound to accept the ""uncontested    findings"" of the south carolina legislature that new construction in the coastal zonesuch as petitioner intendedthreatened this public resource. id., at 383, 404 s. e. 2d, at 898. the court ruled that when a regulation respecting the use of property is designed ""to prevent serious public harm,"" id., at 383, 404 s. e. 2d, at 899 (citing, inter alia, mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under the takings clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value. two justices dissented. they acknowledged that our mugler line of cases recognizes governmental power to prohibit ""noxious"" uses of propertyi. e., uses of property akin to ""public nuisances""without having to pay compensation. but they would not have characterized the beachfront management act's ""primary purpose the prevention of a nuisance."" 304 s. c., at 395, 404 s. e. 2d, at 906 (harwell, j., dissenting). to the dissenters, the chief purposes of the legislation, among them the promotion of tourism and the creation of a ""habitat for indigenous flora and fauna,"" could not fairly be compared to nuisance abatement. id., at 396, 404 s. e. 2d, at 906. as a consequence, they would have affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the act's obliteration of the value of petitioner's lots accomplished a taking. we granted certiorari. 502 u. s. 966 (1991).iias a threshold matter, we must briefly address the council's suggestion that this case is inappropriate for plenary review. after briefing and argument before the south carolina supreme court, but prior to issuance of that court's opinion, the beach front management act was amended to authorize the council, in certain circumstances, to issue ""special permits"" for the construction or reconstruction of habitable structures seaward of the baseline. see s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(d)(1) (supp. 1991). according to the council, this amendment renders lucas's claim of a permanent deprivation unripe, as lucas may yet be able to secure permission to build on his property.  cases,"" we are reminded, ""uniformly reflect an insistence on knowing the nature and extent of permitted development before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purport to limit it."" macdonald, sommer; frates v. yolo county, 477 u. s. 340, 351 (1986). see also agins v. city of tiburon, 447 u. s. 255, 260 (1980). because petitioner ""has not yet obtained a final decision regarding how will be allowed to develop property,"" williamson county regional planning comm'n v. hamilton bank of johnson city, 473 u. s. 172, 190 (1985), the council argues that he is not yet entitled to definitive adjudication of his takings claim in this court. we think these considerations would preclude review had the south carolina supreme court rested its judgment on ripeness grounds, as it was (essentially) invited to do by the council. see brief for respondent 9, n. 3. the south carolina supreme court shrugged off the possibility of further administrative and trial proceedings, however, preferring to dispose of lucas's takings claim on the merits. cf., e. g., san diego gas  electric co. v. san diego, 450 u. s. 621, 631-632 (1981). this unusual disposition does not preclude lucas from applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment for future construction, and challenging, on takings grounds, any denial. but it does preclude, both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to lucas's past deprivation, i. e., for his having been denied construction rights during the period before the 1990 amendment. see generally first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304 (1987) (holding that temporary deprivations of use are compensable under the takings clause). without even so much as commenting upon the consequences of the south carolina supreme court's judgment in this respect, the council insists that permitting lucas to press his claim of a past deprivation on this appeal would be improper, since ""the issues of whether and to what extent has incurred a temporary taking    have simply never been addressed."" brief for respondent 11. yet lucas had no reason to proceed on a ""temporary taking"" theory at trial, or even to seek remand for that purpose prior to submission of the case to the south carolina supreme court, since as the act then read, the taking was unconditional and permanent. moreover, given the breadth of the south carolina supreme court's holding and judgment, lucas would plainly be unable (absent our intervention now) to obtain further state-court adjudication with respect to the 1988-1990 period. in these circumstances, we think it would not accord with sound process to insist that lucas pursue the late-created ""special permit"" procedure before his takings claim can be considered ripe. lucas has properly alleged article iii injury in fact in this case, with respect to both the pre-1990 and post-1990 constraints placed on the use of his parcels by the beachfront management act. that there is a discretionary ""special permit"" procedure by which he may regainfor the future, at leastbeneficial use of his land goes only to the prudential ""ripeness"" of lucas's challenge, and for the reasons discussed we do not think it prudent to apply that prudential requirement here. see esposito v. south carolina coastal council, 939 f. 2d 165, 168 (ca4 1991), cert. denied, post, p. 1219. we leave for decision on remand, of course, the questions left unaddressed by the south carolina supreme court as a consequence of its categorical disposition.iiiaprior to justice holmes's exposition in pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the takings clause reached only a ""direct appropriation"" of property, legal tender cases, 12 wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a ""practical ouster of possession,"" transportation co. v. chicago, 99 u. s. 635, 642 (1879). see also gibson v. united states, 166 u. s. 269, 275-276 (1897). justice holmes recognized in mahon, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government's power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 u. s., at 414-415. if, instead, the uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, ""the natural tendency of human nature to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappear."" id., at 415. these considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, ""while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking."" ibid. nevertheless, our decision in mahon offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going ""too far"" for purposes of the fifth amendment. in 70-odd years of succeeding ""regulatory takings"" jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any ""`set formula'  for determining how far is too far, preferring to ""engag in    essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries."" penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590, 594 (1962)). see epstein, takings: descent and resurrection, 1987 s. ct. rev. 1, 4. we have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint. the first encompasses regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical ""invasion"" of his property. in general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation. for example, in loretto v. teleprompter manhattan catv corp., 458 u. s. 419 (1982), we determined that new york's law requiring landlords to allow television cable companies to emplace cable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a taking, id., at 435-440, even though the facilities occupied at most only 1 12 cubic feet of the landlords' property, see id., at 438, n. 16. see also united states v. causby, 328 u. s. 256, 265, and n. 10 (1946) (physical invasions of airspace); cf. kaiser aetna v. united states, 444 u. s. 164 (1979) (imposition of navigational servitude upon private marina). the second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. see agins, 447 u. s., at 260; see also nollan v. california coastal comm'n, 483 u. s. 825, 834 (1987); keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis, 480 u. s. 470, 495 (1987); hodel v. virginia surface mining  reclamation assn., inc., 452 u. s. 264, 295-296 (1981). as we have said on numerous occasions, the fifth amendment is violated when land-use regulation ""does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or denies an owner economically viable use of his land.  agins, supra, at 260 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). we have never set forth the justification for this rule. perhaps it is simply, as justice brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. see san diego gas  electric co. v. san diego, 450 u. s., at 652 (dissenting opinion). ""or what is the land but the profits thereof"" 1 e. coke, institutes, ch. 1,  1 (1st am. ed. 1812). surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply ""adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,"" penn central transportation co., 438 u. s., at 124, in a manner that secures an ""average reciprocity of advantage"" to everyone concerned, pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s., at 415. and the functional basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensationthat ""government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,"" id., at 413does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses. on the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its usetypically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural statecarry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm. see, e. g., annicelli v. south kingstown, 463 a. 2d 133, 140-141 (r. i. 1983) (prohibition on construction adjacent to beach justified on twin grounds of safety and ""conservation of open space""); morris county land improvement co. v. parsippany-troy hills township, 40 n. j.539, 552-553, 193 a. 2d 232, 240 (1963) (prohibition on filling marshlands imposed in order to preserve region as water detention basin and create wildlife refuge). as justice brennan explained: ""from the government's point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production through a dam project that floods private property."" san diego gas  elec. co., supra, at 652 (dissenting opinion). the many statutes on the books, both state and federal, that provide for the use of eminent domain to impose servitudes on private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to acquire such lands altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this setting of negative regulation and appropriation. see, e. g., 16 u. s. c.  410ff-1(a) (authorizing acquisition of ""lands, waters, or interests (including but not limited to scenic easements)"");  460aa-2(a) (authorizing acquisition of ""any lands, or lesser interests therein, including mineral interests and scenic easements"" within sawtooth national recreation area);  3921-3923 (authorizing acquisition of wetlands); n. c. gen. stat.  113a-38 (1990) (authorizing acquisition of, inter alia, ""`scenic easements'  within the north carolina natural and scenic rivers system); tenn. code ann.  11-15-101 to 11-15-108 (1987) (authorizing acquisition of ""protective easements"" and other rights in real property adjacent to state's historic, architectural, archaeological, or cultural resources). we think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.bthe trial court found lucas's two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by respondent's enforcement of the coastal-zone construction ban. under lucas's theory of the case, which rested upon our ""no economically viable use"" statements, that finding entitled him to compensation. lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the purposes behind the beachfront management act, or the means chosen by the south carolina legislature to effectuate those purposes. the south carolina supreme court, however, thought otherwise. in its view, the beachfront management act was no ordinary enactment, but involved an exercise of south carolina's ""police powers"" to mitigate the harm to the public interest that petitioner's use of his land might occasion. 304 s. c., at 384, 404 s. e. 2d, at 899. by neglecting to dispute the findings enumerated in the act or otherwise to challenge the legislature's purposes, petitioner ""concede that the beach/dune area of south carolina's shores is an extremely valuable public resource; that the erection of new construction, inter alia, contributes to the erosion and destruction of this public resource; and that discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm."" id., at 382-383, 404 s. e. 2d, at 898. in the court's view, these concessions brought petitioner's challenge within a long line of this court's cases sustaining against due process and takings clause challenges the state's use of its ""police powers"" to enjoin a property owner from activities akin to public nuisances. see mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages); hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915) (law barring operation of brick mill in residential area); miller v. schoene, 276 u. s. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees to prevent infection of nearby orchards); goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in residential area). it is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that ""harmful or noxious uses"" of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation. for a number of reasons, however, we think the south carolina supreme court was too quick to conclude that that principle decides the present case. the ""harmful or noxious uses"" principle was the court's early attempt to describe in theoretical terms why government may, consistent with the takings clause, affect property values by regulation without incurring an obligation to compensatea reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with respect to the full scope of the state's police power. see, e. g., penn central transportation co., 438 u. s., at 125 (where state ""reasonably conclude that `the health, safety, morals, or general welfare' would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land,"" compensation need not accompany prohibition); see also nollan v. california coastal comm'n, 483 u. s., at 834-835 (""our cases have not elaborated on the standards for determining what constitutes a `legitimate state interest' hey have made clear    that a broad range of governmental purposes and regulations satisfy these requirements""). we made this very point in penn central transportation co., where, in the course of sustaining new york city's landmarks preservation program against a takings challenge, we rejected the petitioner's suggestion that mugler and the cases following it were premised on, and thus limited by, some objective conception of ""noxiousness"":he uses in issue in hadacheck, miller, and goldblatt were perfectly lawful in themselves. they involved no `blameworthiness,    moral wrongdoing or conscious act of dangerous risk-taking which induce to shift the cost to a paicular individual.' sax, takings and the police power, 74 yale l. j. 36, 50 (1964). these cases are better understood as resting not on any supposed `noxious' quality of the prohibited uses but rather on the ground that the restrictions were reasonably related to the implementation of a policynot unlike historic preservationexpected to produce a widespread public benefit and applicable to all similarly situated property."" 438 u. s., at 133-134, n. 30. harmful or noxious use"" analysis was, in other words, simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that ""land-use regulation does not effect a taking if it `substantially advance legitimate state interests'  .. ."" nollan, supra, at 834 (quoting agins v. tiburon, 447 u. s., at 260); see also penn central transportation co., supra, at 127; euclid v. ambler realty co., 272 u. s. 365, 387-388 (1926).the transition from our early focus on control of ""noxious"" uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realm within which government may regulate without compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between ""harmpreventing"" and ""benefit-conferring"" regulation is often in the eye of the beholder. it is quite possible, for example, to describe in either fashion the ecological, economic, and esthetic concerns that inspired the south carolina legislature in the present case. one could say that imposing a servitude on lucas's land is necessary in order to prevent his use of it from ""harming"" south carolina's ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the ""benefits"" of an ecological preserve. compare, e. g., claridge v. new hampshire wetlands board, 125 n. h. 745, 752, 485 a. 2d 287, 292 (1984) (owner may, without compensation, be barred from filling wetlands because landfilling would deprive adjacent coastal habitats and marine fisheries of ecological support), with, e. g., bartlett v. zoning comm'n of old lyme, 161 conn. 24, 30, 282 a. 2d 907, 910 (1971) (owner barred from filling tidal marshland must be compensated, despite municipality's ""laudable"" goal of ""preserv marshlands from encroachment or destruction""). whether one or the other of the competing characterizations will come to one's lips in a particular case depends primarily upon one's evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate. see restatement (second) of torts  822, comment g, p. 112 (1979) (""practically all human activities unless carried on in a wilderness interfere to some extent with others or involve some risk of interference""). a given restraint will be seen as mitigating ""harm"" to the adjacent parcels or securing a ""benefit"" for them, depending upon the observer's evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. see sax, takings and the police power, 74 yale l. j. 36, 49 (1964) (""he problem is not one of noxiousness or harm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem of inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independently desirable uses""). whether lucas's construction of singlefamily residences on his parcels should be described as bringing ""harm"" to south carolina's adjacent ecological resources thus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the state's use interest in nurturing those resources is so important that any competing adjacent use must yield. when it is understood that ""prevention of harmful use"" was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in value; and that the distinction between regulation that ""prevents harmful use"" and that which ""confers benefits"" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident that noxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory ""takings""  which require compensation  from regulatory deprivations that do not require compensation. a fortiori the legislature's recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. if it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. the south carolina supreme court's approach would essentially nullify mahon `s affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. our cases provide no support for this: none of them that employed the logic of ""harmful use"" prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of the claimant's land. see keystone bituminous coal assn., 480 u. s., at 513-514 (rehnquist, c. j., dissenting). where the state seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with. this accords, we think, with our ""takings"" jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and the state's power over, the ""bundle of rights"" that they acquire when they obtain title to property. it seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the state in legitimate exercise of its police powers; ""s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power."" pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s., at 413. and in the case of personal property, by reason of the state's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless (at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale). see andrus v. allard, 444 u. s. 51, 66-67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). in the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the council that title is somehow held subject to the ""implied limitation"" that the state may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the takings clause that has become part of our constitutional culture. where ""permanent physical occupation"" of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decree it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted ""public interests"" involved, loretto v. teleprompter manhattan catv corp., 458 u. s., at 426  though we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the landowner's title. compare scranton v. wheeler, 179 u. s. 141, 163 (1900) (interests of ""riparian owner in the submerged lands    bordering on a public navigable water"" held subject to government's navigational servitude), with kaiser aetna v. united states, 444 u. s., at 178-180 (imposition of navigational servitude on marina created and rendered navigable at private expense held to constitute a taking). we believe similar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations, i. e., regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial use of land: any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the state's law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership. a law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts  by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the state's law of private nuisance, or by the state under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public generally, or otherwise. on this analysis, the owner of a lake bed, for example, would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to engage in a land filling operation that would have the effect of flooding others' land. nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. such regulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating the land's only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles. the use of these properties for what are now expressly prohibited purposes was always unlawful, and (subject to other constitutional limitations) it was open to the state at any point to make the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. see michelman, property, utility, and fairness, comments on the ethical foundations of ""just compensation"" law, 80 harv. l. rev. 1165, 1239  1241 (1967). in light of our traditional resort to ""existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law"" to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as ""property"" under the fifth and fourteenth amendments, board of regents of state colleges v. roth, 408 u. s. 564, 577 (1972); see, e. g., ruckelshaus v. monsanto co., 467 u. s. 986, 1011-1012 (1984); hughes v. washington, 389 u. s. 290, 295 (1967) (stewart, j., concurring), this recognition that the takings clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land to a use that is proscribed by those ""existing rules or understandings"" is surely unexceptional. when, however, a regulation that declares ""off-limits"" all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it. the ""total taking"" inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant's proposed activities, see, e. g., restatement (second) of torts  826, 827, the social value of the claimant's activities and their suitability to the locality in question, see, e. g., id.,  828(a) and (b), 831, and the relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided through measures taken by the claimant and the government (or adjacent private landowners) alike, see, e. g., id.,  827(e), 828(c), 830. the fact that a particular use has long been engaged in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a lack of any common-law prohibition (though changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so, see id.,  827, comment g. so also does the fact that other landowners, similarly situated, are permitted to continue the use denied to the claimant. it seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on petitioner's land; they rarely support prohibition of the ""essential use"" of land, curtin v. benson, 222 u. s. 78, 86 (1911). the question, however, is one of state law to be dealt with on remand. we emphasize that to win its case south carolina must do more than proffer the legislature's declaration that the uses lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. as we have said, a ""state, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation    ."" webb's fabulous pharmacies, inc. v. beckwith, 449 u. s. 155, 164 (1980). instead, as it would be required to do if it sought to restrain lucas in a commonlaw action for public nuisance, south carolina must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found. only on this showing can the state fairly claim that, in proscribing all such beneficial uses, the beach front management act is taking nothing.    the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. so ordered.justice kennedy, concurring in the judgment.the case comes to the court in an unusual posture, as all my colleagues observe. ante, at 1010-1011; post, at 1041 (blackmun, j., dissenting); post, at 1061-1062 (stevens, j., dissenting); post, at 1076-1077 (statement of souter, j.). after the suit was initiated but before it reached us, south carolina amended its beach front management act to authorize the issuance of special permits at variance with the act's general limitations. see s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(d)(1) (supp. 1991). petitioner has not applied for a special permit but may still do so. the availability of this alternative, if it can be invoked, may dispose of petitioner's claim of a permanent taking. as i read the court's opinion, it does not decide the permanent taking claim, but neither does it foreclose the supreme court of south carolina from considering the claim or requiring petitioner to pursue an administrative alternative not previously available. the potential for future relief does not control our disposition, because whatever may occur in the future cannot undo what has occurred in the past. the beach front management act was enacted in 1988. s. c. code ann.  48-39-250 et seq. (supp. 1990). it may have deprived petitioner of the use of his land in an interim period.  48-39-290(a). if this deprivation amounts to a taking, its limited duration will not bar constitutional relief. it is well established that temporary takings are as protected by the constitution as are permanent ones. first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304, 318 (1987). the issues presented in the case are ready for our decision. the supreme court of south carolina decided the case on constitutional grounds, and its rulings are now before us. there exists no jurisdictional bar to our disposition, and prudential considerations ought not to militate against it. the state cannot complain of the manner in which the issues arose. any uncertainty in this regard is attributable to the state, as a consequence of its amendment to the beach front management act. if the takings clause is to protect against temporary deprivations, as well as permanent ones, its enforcement must not be frustrated by a shifting background of state law. although we establish a framework for remand, moreover, we do not decide the ultimate question whether a temporary taking has occurred in this case. the facts necessary to the determination have not been developed in the record. among the matters to be considered on remand must be whether petitioner had the intent and capacity to develop the property and failed to do so in the interim period because the state prevented him. any failure by petitioner to comply with relevant administrative requirements will be part of that analysis. the south carolina court of common pleas found that petitioner's real property has been rendered valueless by the state's regulation. app. to pet. for cert. 37. the finding appears to presume that the property has no significant market value or resale potential. this is a curious finding, and i share the reservations of some of my colleagues about a finding that a beach front lot loses all value because of a development restriction. post, at 1043-1045 (blackmun, j., dissenting); post, at 1065, n. 3 (stevens, j., dissenting); post, at 1076 (statement of souter, j.). while the supreme court of south carolina on remand need not consider the case subject to this constraint, we must accept the finding as entered below. see oklahoma city v. tuttle, 471 u. s. 808, 816 (1985). accepting the finding as entered, it follows that petitioner is entitled to invoke the line of cases discussing regulations that deprive real property of all economic value. see agins v. city of tiburon, 447 u. s. 255, 260 (1980). the finding of no value must be considered under the takings clause by reference to the owner's reasonable, investment-backed expectations. kaiser aetna v. united states, 444 u. s. 164, 175 (1979); penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 124 (1978); see also w. b. worthen co. v. kavanaugh, 295 u. s. 56 (1935). the takings clause, while conferring substantial protection on property owners, does not eliminate the police power of the state to enact limitations on the use of their property. mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623, 669 (1887). the rights conferred by the takings clause and the police power of the state may coexist without conflict. property is bought and sold, investments are made, subject to the state's power to regulate. where a taking is alleged from regulations which deprive the property of all value, the test must be whether the deprivation is contrary to reasonable, investmentbacked expectations. there is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this synthesis, of course; for if the owner's reasonable expectations are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exercise of governmental authority, property tends to become what courts say it is. some circularity must be tolerated in these matters, however, as it is in other spheres. e. g., katz v. united states, 389 u. s. 347 (1967) (fourth amendment protections defined by reasonable expectations of privacy). the definition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. the expectations protected by the constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved. in my view, reasonable expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition. the common law of nuisance is too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society. goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590, 593 (1962). the state should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to changing conditions, and courts must consider all reasonable expectations whatever their source. the takings clause does not require a static body of state property law; it protects private expectations to ensure private investment. i agree with the court that nuisance prevention accords with the most common expectations of property owners who face regulation, but i do not believe this can be the sole source of state authority to impose severe restrictions. coastal property may present such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the state can go further in regulating its development and use than the common law of nuisance might otherwise permit. the supreme court of south carolina erred, in my view, by reciting the general purposes for which the state regulations were enacted without a determination that they were in accord with the owner's reasonable expectations and therefore sufficient to support a severe restriction on specific parcels of property. see 304 s. c. 376, 383, 404 s. e. 2d 895, 899 (1991). the promotion of tourism, for instance, ought not to suffice to deprive specific property of all value without a corresponding duty to compensate. furthermore, the means, as well as the ends, of regulation must accord with the owner's reasonable expectations. here, the state did not act until after the property had been zoned for individual lot development and most other parcels had been improved, throwing the whole burden of the regulation on the remaining lots. this too must be measured in the balance. see pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393, 416 (1922). with these observations, i concur in the judgment of the court.justice blackmun, dissenting.today the court launches a missile to kill a mouse. the state of south carolina prohibited petitioner lucas from building a permanent structure on his property from 1988 to 1990. relying on an unreviewed (and implausible) state trial court finding that this restriction left lucas' property valueless, this court granted review to determine whether compensation must be paid in cases where the state prohibits all economic use of real estate. according to the court, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our prior cases, and the court imagines that it will arise ""relatively rarely"" or only in ""extraordinary circumstances."" almost certainly it did not happen in this case. nonetheless, the court presses on to decide the issue, and as it does, it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its traditional rules of review, and creates simultaneously a new categorical rule and an exception (neither of which is rooted in our prior case law, common law, or common sense). i protest not only the court's decision, but each step taken to reach it. more fundamentally, i question the court's wisdom in issuing sweeping new rules to decide such a narrow case. surely, as justice kennedy demonstrates, the court could have reached the result it wanted without inflicting this damage upon our takings clause jurisprudence. my fear is that the court's new policies will spread beyond the narrow confines of the present case. for that reason, i, like the court, will give far greater attention to this case than its narrow scope suggests  not because i can intercept the court's missile, or save the targeted mouse, but because i hope perhaps to limit the collateral damage.iain 1972 congress passed the coastal zone management act. 16 u. s. c.  1451 et seq. the act was designed to provide states with money and incentives to carry out congress' goal of protecting the public from shoreline erosion and coastal hazards. in the 1980 amendments to the act, congress directed states to enhance their coastal programs by ""reventing or significantly reducing threats to life and the destruction of property by eliminating development and redevelopment in high-hazard areas."" 16 u. s. c.  1456b(a)(2) (1988 ed., supp. ii). south carolina began implementing the congressional directive by enacting the south carolina coastal zone management act of 1977. under the 1977 act, any construction activity in what was designated the ""critical area"" required a permit from the south carolina coastal council (council), and the construction of any habitable structure was prohibited. the 1977 critical area was relatively narrow. this effort did not stop the loss of shoreline. in october 1986, the council appointed a ""blue ribbon committee on beach front management"" to investigate beach erosion and propose possible solutions. in march 1987, the committee found that south carolina's beaches were ""critically eroding,"" and proposed land-use restrictions. report of the south carolina blue ribbon committee on beach front management i, 6-10 (mar. 1987). in response, south carolina enacted the beach front management act on july 1, 1988. s. c. code ann.  48-39-250 et seq. (supp. 1990). the 1988 act did not change the uses permitted within the designated critical areas. rather, it enlarged those areas to encompass the distance from the mean high watermark to a setback line established on the basis of ""the best scientific and historical data"" available. s. c. code ann.  48-39-280 (supp. 1991).bpetitioner lucas is a contractor, manager, and part owner of the wild dune development on the isle of palms. he has lived there since 1978. in december 1986, he purchased two of the last four pieces of vacant property in the development. the area is notoriously unstable. in roughly half of the last 40 years, all or part of petitioner's property was part of the beach or flooded twice daily by the ebb and flow of the tide. tr. 84. between 1957 and 1963, petitioner's property was under water. id., at 79, 81-82. between 1963 and 1973 the shoreline was 100 to 150 feet onto petitioner's property. ibid. in 1973 the first line of stable vegetation was about halfway through the property. id., at 80. between 1981 and 1983, the isle of palms issued 12 emergency orders for sandbagging to protect property in the wild dune development. id., at 99. determining that local habitable structures were in imminent danger of collapse, the council issued permits for two rock revetments to protect condominium developments near petitioner's property from erosion; one of the revetments extends more than halfway onto one of his lots. id., at 102.cthe south carolina supreme court found that the beach front management act did not take petitioner's property without compensation. the decision rested on two premises that until today were unassailable  that the state has the power to prevent any use of property it finds to be harmful to its citizens, and that a state statute is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. the beach front management act includes a finding by the south carolina general assembly that the beach/dune system serves the purpose of ""protect life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economical and effective manner."" s. c. code ann.  48-39-250(1)(a) (supp. 1990). the general assembly also found that ""development unwisely has been sited too close to the system. this type of development has jeopardized the stability of the beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacent property.""  48-39-250(4); see also  48-39-250(6) (discussing the need to ""afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode""). if the state legislature is correct that the prohibition on building in front of the setback line prevents serious harm, then, under this court's prior cases, the act is constitutional. ""long ago it was recognized that all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner's use of it shall not be injurious to the community, and the takings clause did not transform that principle to one that requires compensation whenever the state asserts its power to enforce it."" keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis, 480 u. s. 470, 491-492 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 488-489, and n. 18. the court consistently has upheld regulations imposed to arrest a significant threat to the common welfare, whatever their economic effect on the owner. see, e. g., goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590, 592-593 (1962); euclid v. ambler realty co., 272 u. s. 365 (1926); gorieb v. fox, 274 u. s. 603, 608 (1927); mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887). petitioner never challenged the legislature's findings that a building ban was necessary to protect property and life. nor did he contend that the threatened harm was not sufficiently serious to make building a house in a particular location a ""harmful"" use, that the legislature had not made sufficient findings, or that the legislature was motivated by anything other than a desire to minimize damage to coastal areas. indeed, petitioner objected at trial that evidence as to the purposes of the setback requirement was irrelevant. tr. 68. the south carolina supreme court accordingly understood petitioner not to contest the state's position that ""discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm,"" 304 s. c. 376, 383, 404 s. e. 2d 895, 898 (1991), and ""to prevent serious injury to the community."" id., at 387, 404 s. e. 2d, at 901. the court considered itself ""bound by these uncontested legislative findings    any attack whatsoever on the statutory scheme."" id., at 383, 404 s. e. 2d, at 898. nothing in the record undermines the general assembly's assessment that prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary to protect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion. because that legislative determination cannot be disregarded in the absence of such evidence, see, e. g., euclid, 272 u. s., at 388; o'gorman  young, inc. v. hartford fire ins. co., 282 u. s. 251, 257-258 (1931) (brandeis, j.), and because its determination of harm to life and property from building is sufficient to prohibit that use under this court's cases, the south carolina supreme court correctly found no taking.iimy disagreement with the court begins with its decision to review this case. this court has held consistently that a land-use challenge is not ripe for review until there is a final decision about what uses of the property will be permitted. the ripeness requirement is not simply a gesture of good will to land-use planners. in the absence of ""a final and authoritative determination of the type and intensity of development legally permitted on the subject property,"" macdonald, sommer  frates v. yolo county, 477 u. s. 340, 348 (1986), and the utilization of state procedures for just compensation, there is no final judgment, and in the absence of a final judgment there is no jurisdiction, see san diego gas  electric co. v. san diego, 450 u. s. 621, 633 (1981); agins v. city of tiburon, 447 u. s. 255, 260 (1980). this rule is ""compelled by the very nature of the inquiry required by the just compensation clause,"" because the factors applied in deciding a takings claim ""simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question."" williamson county regional planning comm'n v. hamilton bank of johnson city, 473 u. s. 172, 190, 191 (1985). see also macdonald, sommer  frates, 477 u. s., at 348 (""a court cannot determine whether a regulation has gone `too far' unless it knows how far the regulation goes"") (citation omitted). the court admits that the 1990 amendments to the beach front management act allowing special permits preclude lucas from asserting that his property has been permanently taken. see ante, at 1011-1012. the court agrees that such a claim would not be ripe because there has been no final decision by respondent on what uses will be permitted. the court, however, will not be denied: it determines that petitioner's ""temporary takings"" claim for the period from july 1, 1988, to june 25, 1990, is ripe. but this claim also is not justiciable. from the very beginning of this litigation, respondent has argued that the courts ""lac jurisdiction in this matter because the plaintiff has sought no authorization from council for use of his property, has not challenged the location of the baseline or setback line as alleged in the complaint and because no final agency decision has been rendered concerning use of his property or location of said baseline or setback line."" tr. 10 (answer, as amended). although the council's plea has been ignored by every court, it is undoubtedly correct. under the beach front management act, petitioner was entitled to challenge the setback line or the baseline or erosion rate applied to his property in formal administrative, followed by judicial, proceedings. s. c. code ann.  48-39 280(e) (supp. 1991). because lucas failed to pursue this administrative remedy, the council never finally decided whether lucas' particular piece of property was correctly categorized as a critical area in which building would not be permitted. this is all the more crucial because lucas argued strenuously in the trial court that his land was perfectly safe to build on, and that his company had studies to prove it. tr. 20, 25, 36. if he was correct, the council's final decision would have been to alter the setback line, eliminating the construction ban on lucas' property. that petitioner's property fell within the critical area as initially interpreted by the council does not excuse petitioner's failure to challenge the act's application to his property in the administrative process. the claim is not ripe until petitioner seeks a variance from that status. ""e have made it quite clear that the mere assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute a regulatory taking."" united states v. riverside bayview homes, inc., 474 u. s. 121, 126 (1985). see also williamson county, 473 u. s., at 188 (claim not ripe because respondent did not seek variances that would have allowed it to develop the property, notwithstanding the commission's finding that the plan did not comply with the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations). even if i agreed with the court that there were no jurisdictional barriers to deciding this case, i still would not try to decide it. the court creates its new takings jurisprudence based on the trial court's finding that the property had lost all economic value. this finding is almost certainly erroneous. petitioner still can enjoy other attributes of ownership, such as the right to exclude others, ""one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property."" kaiser aetna v. united states, 444 u. s. 164, 176 (1979). petitioner can picnic, swim, camp in a tent, or live on the property in a movable trailer. state courts frequently have recognized that land has economic value where the only residual economic uses are recreation or camping. see, e. g., turnpike realty co. v. dedham, 362 mass. 221, 284 n. e. 2d 891 (1972); turner v. county of del norte, 24 cal. app. 3d 311, 101 cal. rptr. 93 (1972), cert. denied, 409 u. s. 1108 (1973); hall v. board of environmental protection, 528 a. 2d 453 (me. 1987). petitioner also retains the right to alienate the land, which would have value for neighbors and for those prepared to enjoy proximity to the ocean without a house. yet the trial court, apparently believing that ""less value"" and ""valueless"" could be used interchangeably, found the property ""valueless."" the court accepted no evidence from the state on the property's value without a home, and petitioner's appraiser testified that he never had considered what the value would be absent a residence. tr. 54-55. the appraiser's value was based on the fact that the ""highest and best use of these lots    luxury single family detached dwellings."" id., at 48. the trial court appeared to believe that the property could be considered ""valueless"" if it was not available for its most profitable use. absent that erroneous assumption, see goldblatt, 369 u. s., at 592, i find no evidence in the record supporting the trial court's conclusion that the damage to the lots by virtue of the restrictions was ""total."" record 128 (findings of fact). i agree with the court, ante, at 1020, n. 9, that it has the power to decide a case that turns on an erroneous finding, but i question the wisdom of deciding an issue based on a factual premise that does not exist in this case, and in the judgment of the court will exist in the future only in ""extraordinary circumstance,"" ante, at 1017. clearly, the court was eager to decide this case. but eagerness, in the absence of proper jurisdiction, must  and in this case should have been  met with restraint.iiithe court's willingness to dispense with precedent in its haste to reach a result is not limited to its initial jurisdictional decision. the court also alters the long-settled rules of review. the south carolina supreme court's decision to defer to legislative judgments in the absence of a challenge from petitioner comports with one of this court's oldest maxims: ""he existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is to be presumed."" united states v. carolene products co., 304 u. s. 144, 152 (1938). indeed, we have said the legislature's judgment is ""well-nigh conclusive."" berman v. par- ker, 348 u. s. 26, 32 (1954). see also sweet v. rechel, 159 u. s. 380, 392 (1895); euclid, 272 u. s., at 388 (""if the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control""). accordingly, this court always has required plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance to provide ""some factual foundation of record"" that contravenes the legislative findings. o'gorman  young  282 u. s., at 258. in the absence of such proof, ""the presumption of constitutionality must prevail."" id., at 257. we only recently have reaffirmed that claimants have the burden of showing a state law constitutes a taking. see keystone bituminous coal, 480 u. s., at 485. see also goldblatt, 369 u. s., at 594 (citing ""the usual presumption of constitutionality"" that applies to statutes attacked as takings). rather than invoking these traditional rules, the court decides the state has the burden to convince the courts that its legislative judgments are correct. despite lucas' complete failure to contest the legislature's findings of serious harm to life and property if a permanent structure is built, the court decides that the legislative findings are not sufficient to justify the use prohibition. instead, the court ""emphasize"" the state must do more than merely proffer its legislative judgments to avoid invalidating its law. ante, at 1031. in this case, apparently, the state now has the burden of showing the regulation is not a taking. the court offers no justification for its sudden hostility toward state legislators, and i doubt that it could.ivthe court does not reject the south carolina supreme court's decision simply on the basis of its disbelief and distrust of the legislature's findings. it also takes the opportunity to create a new scheme for regulations that eliminate all economic value. from now on, there is a categorical rule finding these regulations to be a taking unless the use they prohibit is a background common-law nuisance or property principle. see ante, at 1028-1031.ai first question the court's rationale in creating a category that obviates a ""case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced,"" ante, at 1015, if all economic value has been lost. if one fact about the court's takings jurisprudence can be stated without contradiction, it is that ""the particular circumstances of each case"" determine whether a specific restriction will be rendered invalid by the government's failure to pay compensation. united states v. central eureka mining co., 357 u. s. 155, 168 (1958). this is so because although we have articulated certain factors to be considered, including the economic impact on the property owner, the ultimate conclusion ""necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests."" agins, 447 u. s., at 261. when the government regulation prevents the owner from any economically valuable use of his property, the private interest is unquestionably substantial, but we have never before held that no public interest can outweigh it. instead the court's prior decisions ""uniformly reject the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a `taking.'  penn central transp. co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 131 (1978). this court repeatedly has recognized the ability of government, in certain circumstances, to regulate property without compensation no matter how adverse the financial effect on the owner may be. more than a century ago, the court explicitly upheld the right of states to prohibit uses of property injurious to public health, safety, or welfare without paying compensation: ""a prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property."" mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s., at 668-669. on this basis, the court upheld an ordinance effectively prohibiting operation of a previously lawful brewery, although the ""establishments will become of no value as property."" id., at 664; see also id., at 668. mugler was only the beginning in a long line of cases. in powell v. pennsylvania, 127 u. s. 678 (1888), the court upheld legislation prohibiting the manufacture of oleomargarine, despite the owner's allegation that ""if prevented from continuing it, the value of his property employed therein would be entirely lost and he be deprived of the means of livelihood."" id., at 682. in hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915), the court upheld an ordinance prohibiting a brickyard, although the owner had made excavations on the land that prevented it from being utilized for any purpose but a brickyard. id., at 405. in miller v. schoene, 276 u. s. 272 (1928), the court held that the fifth amendment did not require virginia to pay compensation to the owner of cedar trees ordered destroyed to prevent a disease from spreading to nearby apple orchards. the ""preferment of over the property interest of the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects property."" id., at 280. again, in omnia commercial co. v. united states, 261 u. s. 502 (1923), the court stated that ""destruction of, or injury to, property is frequently accomplished without a `taking' in the constitutional sense."" id., at 508. more recently, in goldblatt, the court upheld a town regulation that barred continued operation of an existing sand and gravel operation in order to protect public safety. 369 u. s., at 596. ""although a comparison of values before and after is relevant,"" the court stated, ""it is by no means conclusive."" id., at 594. in 1978, the court declared that ""in instances in which a state tribunal reasonably concluded that `the health, safety, morals, or general welfare' would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, this court has upheld land-use regulation that destroyed    recognized real property interests."" penn central transp. co., 438 u. s., at 125. in first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304 (1987), the owner alleged that a floodplain ordinance had deprived it of ""all use"" of the property. id., at 312. the court remanded the case for consideration whether, even if the ordinance denied the owner all use, it could be justified as a safety measure. id., at 313. and in keystone bituminous coal, the court summarized over 100 years of precedent: ""he court has repeatedly upheld regulations that destroy or adversely affect real property interests."" 480 u. s., at 489, n. 18. the court recognizes that ""our prior opinions have suggested that `harmful or noxious uses' of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of compensation,"" ante, at 1022, but seeks to reconcile them with its categorical rule by claiming that the court never has upheld a regulation when the owner alleged the loss of all economic value. even if the court's factual premise were correct, its understanding of the court's cases is distorted. in none of the cases did the court suggest that the right of a state to prohibit certain activities without paying compensation turned on the availability of some residual valuable use. instead, the cases depended on whether the government interest was sufficient to prohibit the activity, given the significant private cost. these cases rest on the principle that the state has full power to prohibit an owner's use of property if it is harmful to the public. ""ince no individual has a right to use his property so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others, the state has not `taken' anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like activity."" keystone bituminous coal, 480 u. s., at 491, n. 20. it would make no sense under this theory to suggest that an owner has a constitutionally protected right to harm others, if only he makes the proper showing of economic loss. see pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393, 418 (1922) (brandeis, j., dissenting) (""restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means, merely because it deprives the owner of the only use to which the property can then be profitably put"").bultimately even the court cannot embrace the full implications of its per se rule: it eventually agrees that there cannot be a categorical rule for a taking based on economic value that wholly disregards the public need asserted. instead, the court decides that it will permit a state to regulate all economic value only if the state prohibits uses that would not be permitted under ""background principles of nuisance and property law.""ante, at 1031. until today, the court explicitly had rejected the contention that the government's power to act without paying compensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is a common-law nuisance. the brewery closed in mugler itself was not a common-law nuisance, and the court specifically stated that it was the role of the legislature to determine what measures would be appropriate for the protection of public health and safety. see 123 u. s., at 661. in upholding the state action in miller, the court found it unnecessary to ""weigh with nicety the question whether the infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to common law; or whether they may be so declared by statute."" 276 u. s., at 280. see also goldblatt, 369 u. s., at 593; hadacheck, 239 u. s., at 411. instead the court has relied in the past, as the south carolina court has done here, on legislative judgments of what constitutes a harm. the court rejects the notion that the state always can prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without granting compensation because ""the distinction between `harmpreventing' and `benefit-conferring' regulation is often in the eye of the beholder."" ante, at 1024. since the characterization will depend ""primarily upon one's evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate,"" ante, at 1025, the court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longer can provide the desired ""objective, value-free basis"" for upholding a regulation, ante, at 1026. the court, however, fails to explain how its proposed common-law alternative escapes the same trap. the threshold inquiry for imposition of the court's new rule, ""deprivation of all economically valuable use,"" itself cannot be determined objectively. as the court admits, whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value of his property will depend on how ""property"" is defined. the ""composition of the denominator in our `deprivation' fraction,"" ante, at 1017, n. 7, is the dispositive inquiry. yet there is no ""objective"" way to define what that denominator should be. ""we have long understood that any land-use regulation can be characterized as the `total' deprivation of an aptly defined entitlement.    alternatively, the same regulation can always be characterized as a mere `partial' withdrawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landholding affected by the regulation    ."" michelman, takings, 1987, 88 colum. l. rev. 1600, 1614 (1988). the court's decision in keystone bituminous coal illustrates this principle perfectly. in keystone, the court determined that the ""support estate"" was ""merely a part of the entire bundle of rights possessed by the owner."" 480 u. s., at 501. thus, the court concluded that the support estate's destruction merely eliminated one segment of the total property. ibid. the dissent, however, characterized the support estate as a distinct property interest that was wholly destroyed. id., at 519. the court could agree on no ""value-free basis"" to resolve this dispute. even more perplexing, however, is the court's reliance on common-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a valuefree takings jurisprudence. in determining what is a nuisance at common law, state courts make exactly the decision that the court finds so troubling when made by the south carolina general assembly today: they determine whether the use is harmful. common-law public and private nuisance law is simply a determination whether a particular use causes harm. see prosser, private action for public nuisance, 52 va. l. rev. 997 (1966) (""nuisance is a french word which means nothing more than harm""). there is nothing magical in the reasoning of judges long dead. they determined a harm in the same way as state judges and legislatures do today. if judges in the 18th and 19th centuries can distinguish a harm from a benefit, why not judges in the 20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? there simply is no reason to believe that new interpretations of the hoary common-law nuisance doctrine will be particularly ""objective"" or ""value free."" once one abandons the level of generality of sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, ante, at 1031, one searches in vain, i think, for anything resembling a principle in the common law of nuisance.cfinally, the court justifies its new rule that the legislature may not deprive a property owner of the only economically valuable use of his land, even if the legislature finds it to be a harmful use, because such action is not part of the ""`long recognized'  ""understandings of our citizens."" ante, at 1027. these ""understandings"" permit such regulation only if the use is a nuisance under the common law. any other course is ""inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the takings clause."" ante, at 1028. it is not clear from the court's opinion where our ""historical compact"" or ""citizens' understanding"" comes from, but it does not appear to be history. the principle that the state should compensate individuals for property taken for public use was not widely established in america at the time of the revolution. ""the colonists    inherited    a concept of property which permitted extensive regulation of the use of that property for the public benefit  regulation that could even go so far as to deny all productive use of the property to the owner if, as coke himself stated, the regulation `extends to the public benefit    for this is for the public, and every one hath benefit by it.'"" f. bosselman, d. callies,  j. banta, the taking issue 80-81 (1973), quoting the case of the king's prerogative in saltpetre, 12 co. rep. 12-13 (1606) (hereinafter bosselman). see also treanor, the origins and original significance of the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment, 94 yale l. j. 694, 697, n. 9 (1985). even into the 19th century, state governments often felt free to take property for roads and other public projects without paying compensation to the owners. see m. horwitz, the transformation of american law, 1780-1860, pp. 63-64 (1977) (hereinafter horwitz); treanor, 94 yale l. j., at 695. as one court declared in 1802, citizens ""were bound to contribute as much of  as by the laws of the country, were deemed necessary for the public convenience."" m'clenachan v. curwin, 3 yeates 362, 373 (pa. 1802). there was an obvious movement toward establishing the just compensation principle during the 19th century, but ""there continued to be a strong current in american legal thought that regarded compensation simply as a `bounty given    by the state' out of `kindness' and not out of justice."" horwitz 65, quoting commonwealth v. fisher, 1 pen.  w. 462, 465 (pa. 1830). see also state v. dawson, 3 hill 100, 103 (s. c. 1836). although, prior to the adoption of the bill of rights, america was replete with land-use regulations describing which activities were considered noxious and forbidden, see bender, the takings clause: principles or politics?, 34 buffalo l. rev. 735, 751 (1985); l. friedman, a history of american law 66-68 (1973), the fifth amendment's takings clause originally did not extend to regulations of property, whatever the effect. see ante, at 1014. most state courts agreed with this narrow interpretation of a taking.

""except for massachusetts, no colony appears to have paid compensation when it built a state-owned road across unimproved land. legislatures provided compensation only for enclosed or improved land."" treanor, 94 yale l. j., at 695 (footnotes omitted). this rule was followed by some states into the 1800's. see horwitz 63-65. with similar result, the common agrarian conception of property limited owners to ""natural"" uses of their land prior to and during much of the 18th century. see id., at 32. thus, for example, the owner could build nothing on his land that would alter the natural flow of water. see id., at 44; see also, e. g., merritt v. parker, 1 coxe 460, 463 (n. j. 1795). some more recent state courts still follow this reasoning. see, e. g., just v. marinette county, 56 wis. 2d 7, 201 n. w. 2d 761, 768 (1972). nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the state's power to regulate harmful uses even to the point of destroying all economic value. nothing in the discussions in congress concerning the takings clause indicates that the clause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine. common-law courts themselves rejected such an understanding. they regularly recognized that it is ""for the legislature to interpose, and by positive enactment to prohibit a use of property which would be injurious to the public."" tewksbury, 11 metc., at 57. chief justice shaw explained in upholding a regulation prohibiting construction of wharves, the existence of a taking did not depend on ""whether a certain erection in tide water is a nuisance at common law or not."" alger, 7 cush., at 104; see also state v. paul, 5 r. i. 185, 193 (1858); commonwealth v. parks, 155 mass. 531, 532, 30 n. e. 174 (1892) (holmes, j.) (""he legislature may change the common law as to nuisances, and may move the line either way, so as to make things nuisances which were not so, or to make things lawful which were nuisances""). in short, i find no clear and accepted ""historical compact"" or ""understanding of our citizens"" justifying the court's new takings doctrine. instead, the court seems to treat history as a grab bag of principles, to be adopted where they support the court's theory, and ignored where they do not. if the court decided that the early common law provides the background principles for interpreting the takings clause, then regulation, as opposed to physical confiscation, would not be compensable. if the court decided that the law of a later period provides the background principles, then regulation might be compensable, but the court would have to confront the fact that legislatures regularly determined which uses were prohibited, independent of the common law, and independent of whether the uses were lawful when the owner purchased. what makes the court's analysis unworkable is its attempt to package the law of two incompatible eras and peddle it as historical fact.vthe court makes sweeping and, in my view, misguided and unsupported changes in our takings doctrine. while it limits these changes to the most narrow subset of government regulation  those that eliminate all economic value from land  these changes go far beyond what is necessary to secure petitioner lucas' private benefit. one hopes they do not go beyond the narrow confines the court assigns them to today. i dissent.justice stevens, dissenting.today the court restricts one judge-made rule and expands another. in my opinion it errs on both counts. proper application of the doctrine of judicial restraint would avoid the premature adjudication of an important constitutional question. proper respect for our precedents would avoid an illogical expansion of the concept of ""regulatory takings.""ias the court notes, ante, at 1010-1011, south carolina's beach front management act has been amended to permit some construction of residences seaward of the line that frustrated petitioner's proposed use of his property. until he exhausts his right to apply for a special permit under that amendment, petitioner is not entitled to an adjudication by this court of the merits of his permanent takings claim. macdonald, sommer  frates v. yolo county, 477 u. s. 340, 351 (1986). it is also not clear that he has a viable ""temporary takings"" claim. if we assume that petitioner is now able to build on the lot, the only injury that he may have suffered is the delay caused by the temporary existence of the absolute statutory ban on construction. we cannot be sure, however, that that delay caused petitioner any harm because the record does not tell us whether his building plans were even temporarily frustrated by the enactment of the statute. thus, on the present record it is entirely possible that petitioner has suffered no injury in fact even if the state statute was unconstitutional when he filed this lawsuit. it is true, as the court notes, that the argument against deciding the constitutional issue in this case rests on prudential considerations rather than a want of jurisdiction. i think it equally clear, however, that a court less eager to decide the merits would follow the wise counsel of justice brandeis in his deservedly famous concurring opinion in ashwander v. tva, 297 u. s. 288, 341 (1936). as he explained, the court has developed ""for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision."" id., at 346. the second of those rules applies directly to this case.2. the court will not `anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.' liverpool, n. y.  p. s. s. co. v. emigration commis- sioners, 113 u. s. 33, 39;  `it is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.' burton v. united states  196 u. s. 283, 295."" id., at 346-347.cavalierly dismissing the doctrine of judicial restraint, the court today tersely announces that ""we do not think it prudent to apply that prudential requirement here."" ante, at 1013. i respectfully disagree and would save consideration of the merits for another day. since, however, the court has reached the merits, i shall do so as well.iiin its analysis of the merits, the court starts from the premise that this court has adopted a ""categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated,"" ante, at 1026, and then sets itself to the task of identifying the exceptional cases in which a state may be relieved of this categorical obligation, ante, at 1027-1029. the test the court announces is that the regulation must ""do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved"" under a state's nuisance law. ante, at 1029. under this test the categorical rule will apply unless the regulation merely makes explicit what was otherwise an implicit limitation on the owner's property rights. in my opinion, the court is doubly in error. the categorical rule the court establishes is an unsound and unwise addition to the law and the court's formulation of the exception to that rule is too rigid and too narrow. the categorical rule as the court recognizes, ante, at 1015, pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393 (1922), provides no support for its  or, indeed, any  categorical rule. to the contrary, justice holmes recognized that such absolute rules ill fit the inquiry into ""regulatory takings."" thus, in the paragraph that contains his famous observation that a regulation may go ""too far"" and thereby constitute a taking, the justice wrote: ""as we already have said, this is a question of degreeand therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions."" id., at 416. what he had ""already    said"" made perfectly clear that justice holmes regarded economic injury to be merely one factor to be weighed: ""one fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution so the question depends upon the particular facts."" id, at 413. nor does the court's new categorical rule find support in decisions following mahon. although in dicta we have sometimes recited that a law ""effects a taking if    denies an owner economically viable use of his land,"" agins v. city of tiburon, 447 u. s. 255, 260 (1980), our rulings have rejected such an absolute position. we have frequently and recently  held that, in some circumstances, a law that renders property valueless may nonetheless not constitute a taking. see, e. g., first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304, 313 (1987); goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590, 596 (1962); united states v. caltex, 344 u. s. 149, 155 (1952); miller v. schoene, 276 u. s. 272 (1928); hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394, 405 (1915); mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623, 657 (1887); cf. ruckelshaus v. monsanto co., 467 u. s. 986, 1011 (1984); connolly v. pension benefit guaranty corporation, 475 u. s. 211, 225 (1986). in short, as we stated in keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis, 480 u. s. 470, 490 (1987), ""`although a comparison of values before and after' a regulatory action `is relevant,    it is by no means conclusive.'  in addition to lacking support in past decisions, the court's new rule is wholly arbitrary. a landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an owner whose property is diminished 100% recovers the land's full value. the case at hand illustrates this arbitrariness well. the beach front management act not only prohibited the building of new dwellings in certain areas, it also prohibited the rebuilding of houses that were ""destroyed beyond repair by natural causes or by fire."" 1988 s. c. acts 634,  3; see also esposito v. south carolina coastal council, 939 f. 2d 165, 167 (ca4 1991). thus, if the homes adjacent to lucas' lot were destroyed by a hurricane one day after the act took effect, the owners would not be able to rebuild, nor would they be assured recovery. under the court's categorical approach, lucas (who has lost the opportunity to build) recovers, while his neighbors (who have lost both the opportunity to build and their homes) do not recover. the arbitrariness of such a rule is palpable. moreover, because of the elastic nature of property rights, the court's new rule will also prove unsound in practice. in response to the rule, courts may define ""property"" broadly and only rarely find regulations to effect total takings. this is the approach the court itself adopts in its revisionist reading of venerable precedents. we are told that  notwithstanding the court's findings to the contrary in each case  the brewery in mugler, the brickyard in hadacheck, and the gravel pit in goldblatt all could be put to ""other uses"" and that, therefore, those cases did not involve total regulatory takings.ante, at 1026, n. 13. on the other hand, developers and investors may market specialized estates to take advantage of the court's new rule. the smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory change will effect a total taking. thus, an investor may, for example, purchase the right to build a multi family home on a specific lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that allows only single-family homes would render the investor's property interest ""valueless."" in short, the categorical rule will likely have one of two effects: either courts will alter the definition of the ""denominator"" in the takings ""fraction,"" rendering the court's categorical rule meaningless, or investors will manipulate the relevant property interests, giving the court's rule sweeping effect. to my mind, neither of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both are distortions of our takings jurisprudence. finally, the court's justification for its new categorical rule is remarkably thin. the court mentions in passing three arguments in support of its rule; none is convincing. first, the court suggests that ""total deprivation of feasible use is, from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation."" ante, at 1017. this argument proves too much. from the ""landowner's point of view,"" a regulation that diminishes a lot's value by 50% is as well ""the equivalent"" of the condemnation of half of the lot. yet, it is well established that a 50% diminution in value does not by itself constitute a taking. see euclid v. ambler realty co., 272 u. s. 365, 384 (1926) (75% diminution in value). thus, the landowner's perception of the regulation cannot justify the court's new rule. second, the court emphasizes that because total takings are ""relatively rare"" its new rule will not adversely affect the government's ability to ""go on."" ante, at 1018. this argument proves too little. certainly it is true that defining a small class of regulations that are per se takings will not greatly hinder important governmental functions  but this is true of any small class of regulations. the court's suggestion only begs the question of why regulations of this particular class should always be found to effect takings. finally, the court suggests that ""regulations that leave the owner ..  without economically beneficial  .. use    carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service."" ibid. as discussed more fully below, see part iii, infra, i agree that the risks of such singling out are of central concern in takings law. however, such risks do not justify a per se rule for total regulatory takings. there is no necessary correlation between ""singling out"" and total takings: a regulation may single out a property owner without depriving him of all of his property, see, e. g., nollan v. california coastal comm'n, 483 u. s. 825, 837 (1987); j. e. d. associates, inc. v. atkinson, 121 n. h. 581, 432 a. 2d 12 (1981); and it may deprive him of all of his property without singling him out, see, e. g., mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887); hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915). what matters in such cases is not the degree of diminution of value, but rather the specificity of the expropriating act. for this reason, the court's third justification for its new rule also fails. in short, the court's new rule is unsupported by prior decisions, arbitrary and unsound in practice, and theoretically unjustified. in my opinion, a categorical rule as important as the one established by the court today should be supported by more history or more reason than has yet been provided.the nuisance exceptionlike many bright-line rules, the categorical rule established in this case is only ""categorical"" for a page or two in the u. s. reports. no sooner does the court state that ""total regulatory takings must be compensated,"" ante, at 1026, than it quickly establishes an exception to that rule. the exception provides that a regulation that renders property valueless is not a taking if it prohibits uses of property that were not ""previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles."" ante, at 1029-1030. the court thus rejects the basic holding in mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887). there we held that a statewide statute that prohibited the owner of a brewery from making alcoholic beverages did not effect a taking, even though the use of the property had been perfectly lawful and caused no public harm before the statute was enacted. we squarely rejected the rule the court adopts today:""it is true, that, when the defendants    erected their breweries, the laws of the state did not forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. but the state did not thereby give any assurance, or come under an obligation, that its legislation upon that subject would remain unchanged. he supervision of the public health and the public morals is a governmental power, `continuing in its nature,' and `to be dealt with as the special exigencies of the moment may require;'    `for this purpose, the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.'  id., at 669.under our reasoning in mugler, a state's decision to prohibit or to regulate certain uses of property is not a compensable taking just because the particular uses were previously lawful. under the court's opinion today, however, if a state should decide to prohibit the manufacture of asbestos, cigarettes, or concealable firearms, for example, it must be prepared to pay for the adverse economic consequences of its decision. one must wonder if government will be able to ""go on"" effectively if it must risk compensation ""for every such change in the general law."" mahon, 260 u. s., at 413. the court's holding today effectively freezes the state's common law, denying the legislature much of its traditional power to revise the law governing the rights and uses of property. until today, i had thought that we had long abandoned this approach to constitutional law. more than a century ago we recognized that ""the great office of statutes is to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances."" munn v. illinois, 94 u. s. 113, 134 (1877). as justice marshall observed about a position similar to that adopted by the court today:if accepted, that claim would represent a return to the era of lochner v. new york, 198 u. s. 45 (1905), when common-law rights were also found immune from revision by state or federal government. such an approach would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century state of development. it would allow no room for change in response to changes in circumstance. the due process clause does not require such a result."" pruneyard shopping center v. robins, 447 u. s. 74, 93 (1980) (concurring opinion).arresting the development of the common law is not only a departure from our prior decisions; it is also profoundly unwise. the human condition is one of constant learning and evolution  both moral and practical. legislatures implement that new learning; in doing so they must often revise the definition of property and the rights of property owners. thus, when the nation came to understand that slavery was morally wrong and mandated the emancipation of all slaves, it, in effect, redefined ""property."" on a lesser scale, our ongoing self-education produces similar changes in the rights of property owners: new appreciation of the significance of endangered species, see, e. g., andrus v. allard, 444 u. s. 51 (1979); the importance of wetlands, see, e. g., 16 u. s. c.  3801 et seq.; and the vulnerability of coastal lands, see, e. g., 16 u. s. c.  1451 et seq., shapes our evolving understandings of property rights. of course, some legislative redefinitions of property will effect a taking and must be compensated  but it certainly cannot be the case that every movement away from common law does so. there is no reason, and less sense, in such an absolute rule. we live in a world in which changes in the economy and the environment occur with increasing frequency and importance. if it was wise a century ago to allow government ""`the largest legislative discretion'  to deal with ""`the special exigencies of the moment,'  mugler, 123 u. s., at 669, it is imperative to do so today. the rule that should govern a decision in a case of this kind should focus on the future, not the past. the court's categorical approach rule will, i fear, greatly hamper the efforts of local officials and planners who must deal with increasingly complex problems in land-use and environmental regulation. as this case  in which the claims of an individual property owner exceed $1 million  well demonstrates, these officials face both substantial uncertainty because of the ad hoc nature of takings law and unacceptable penalties if they guess incorrectly about that law. viewed more broadly, the court's new rule and exception conflict with the very character of our takings jurisprudence. we have frequently and consistently recognized that the definition of a taking cannot be reduced to a ""set formula"" and that determining whether a regulation is a taking is ""essentially ad hoc, factual inquir."" penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s., at 594). this is unavoidable, for the determination whether a law effects a taking is ultimately a matter of ""fairness and justice,"" armstrong v. united states, 364 u. s. 40, 49 (1960), and ""necessarily requires a weighing of private and public interests,"" agins, 447 u. s., at 261. the rigid rules fixed by the court today clash with this enterprise: ""fairness and justice"" are often disserved by categorical rules.iiiit is well established that a takings case ""entails inquiry into the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations."" pruneyard, 447 u. s., at 83. the court's analysis today focuses on the last two of these three factors: the categorical rule addresses a regulation's ""economic impact,"" while the nuisance exception recognizes that ownership brings with it only certain ""expectations."" neglected by the court today is the first and, in some ways, the most important factor in takings analysis: the character of the regulatory action. the just compensation clause ""was designed to bar government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."" armstrong, 364 u. s., at 49. accordingly, one of the central concerns of our takings jurisprudence is ""prevent the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government."" monongahela navigation co. v. united states, 148 u. s. 312, 325 (1893). we have, therefore, in our takings law frequently looked to the generality of a regulation of property. for example, in the case of so-called ""developmental exactions,"" we have paid special attention to the risk that particular landowners might ""b singled out to bear the burden"" of a broader problem not of his own making. nollan, 483 u. s., at 835, n. 4; see also pennell v. san jose, 485 u. s. 1, 23 (1988). similarly, in distinguishing between the kohler act (at issue in mahon  and the subsidence act (at issue in keystone ), we found significant that the regulatory function of the latter was substantially broader. unlike the kohler act, which simply transferred back to the surface owners certain rights that they had earlier sold to the coal companies, the subsidence act affected all surface owners  including the coal companies  equally. see keystone, 480 u. s., at 486. perhaps the most familiar application of this principle of generality arises in zoning cases. a diminution in value caused by a zoning regulation is far less likely to constitute a taking if it is part of a general and comprehensive land-use plan, see euclid v. amber realty co., 272 u. s. 365 (1926); conversely, ""spot zoning"" is far more likely to constitute a taking, see penn central, 438 u. s., at 132, and n. 28. the presumption that a permanent physical occupation, no matter how slight, effects a taking is wholly consistent with this principle. a physical taking entails a certain amount of ""singling out."" consistent with this principle, physical occupations by third parties are more likely to effect takings than other physical occupations. thus, a regulation requiring the installation of a junction box owned by a third party, loretto v. teleprompter manhattan catv corp., 458 u. s. 419 (1982), is more troubling than a regulation requiring the installation of sprinklers or smoke detectors; just as an order granting third parties access to a marina,kaiser aetna v. united states, 444 u. s. 164 (1979), is more troubling than an order requiring the placement of safety buoys in the marina. in analyzing takings claims, courts have long recognized the difference between a regulation that targets one or two parcels of land and a regulation that enforces a statewide policy. see, e. g., a. a. profiles, inc. v. ft. lauderdale, 850 f. 2d 1483, 1488 (ca11 1988); wheeler v. pleasant grove, 664 f. 2d 99, 100 (ca5 1981); trustees under will of pomeroy v. westlake, 357 so. 2d 1299, 1304 (la. app. 1978); see also burrows v. keene, 121 n. h. 590, 596, 432 a. 2d 15, 21 (1981); herman glick realty co. v. st. louis county, 545 s. w. 2d 320, 324-325 (mo. app. 1976); huttig v. richmond heights, 372 s. w. 2d 833, 842-843 (mo. 1963). as one early court stated with regard to a waterfront regulation, ""if such restraint were in fact imposed upon the estate of one proprietor only, out of several estates on the same line of shore, the objection would be much more formidable."" commonwealth v. alger, 61 mass. 53, 102 (1851). in considering lucas' claim, the generality of the beach front management act is significant. the act does not target particular landowners, but rather regulates the use of the coastline of the entire state. see s. c. code ann.  48 39-10 (supp. 1990). indeed, south carolina's act is best understood as part of a national effort to protect the coastline, one initiated by the federal coastal zone management act of 1972. pub. l. 92-583, 86 stat. 1280, codified as amended at 16 u. s. c.  1451 et seq. pursuant to the federal act, every coastal state has implemented coastline regulations. moreover, the act did not single out owners of undeveloped land. the act also prohibited owners of developed land from rebuilding if their structures were destroyed, see 1988 s. c. acts 634,  3, and what is equally significant, from repairing erosion control devices, such as seawalls, see s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(b)(2) (supp. 1990). in addition, in some situations, owners of developed land were required to ""renouris the beach    on a yearly basis with an amount.   of sand    not    less than one and one-half times the yearly volume of sand lost due to erosion."" 1988 s. c. acts 634,  3, p. 5140. in short, the south carolina act imposed substantial burdens on owners of developed and undeveloped land alike. this generality indicates that the act is not an effort to expropriate owners of undeveloped land. admittedly, the economic impact of this regulation is dramatic and petitioner's investment-backed expectations are substantial. yet, if anything, the costs to and expectations of the owners of developed land are even greater: i doubt, however, that the cost to owners of developed land of renourishing the beach and allowing their seawalls to deteriorate effects a taking. the costs imposed on the owners of undeveloped land, such as petitioner, differ from these costs only in degree, not in kind. the impact of the ban on developmental uses must also be viewed in light of the purposes of the act. the legislature stated the purposes of the act as ""protect, preserv, restor and enhanc the beach/dune system"" of the state not only for recreational and ecological purposes, but also to ""protec life and property."" s. c. code ann.  48 39-260(1)(a) (supp. 1990). the state, with much science on its side, believes that the ""beach/dune system as a buffer from high tides, storm surge, hurricanes."" ibid. this is a traditional and important exercise of the state's police power, as demonstrated by hurricane hugo, which in 1989, caused 29 deaths and more than $6 billion in property damage in south carolina alone. in view of all of these factors, even assuming that petitioner's property was rendered valueless, the risk inherent in investments of the sort made by petitioner, the generality of the act, and the compelling purpose motivating the south carolina legislature persuade me that the act did not effect a taking of petitioner's property. accordingly, i respectfully dissent.statement of justice souter.i would dismiss the writ of certiorari in this case as having been granted improvidently. after briefing and argument it is abundantly clear that an unreviewable assumption on which this case comes to us is both questionable as a conclusion of fifth amendment law and sufficient to frustrate the court's ability to render certain the legal premises on which its holding rests. the petition for review was granted on the assumption that the state by regulation had deprived the owner of his entire economic interest in the subject property. such was the state trial court's conclusion, which the state supreme court did not review. it is apparent now that in light of our prior cases, see, e. g., keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis  480 u. s. 470, 493-502 (1987); andrus v. allard, 444 u. s. 51, 65-66 (1979); penn central transportation corp. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 130-131 (1978), the trial court's conclusion is highly questionable. while the respondent now wishes to contest the point, see brief for respondent 45-50, the court is certainly right to refuse to take up the issue, which is not fairly included within the question presented, and has received only the most superficial and one-sided treatment before us. because the questionable conclusion of total deprivation cannot be reviewed, the court is precluded from attempting to clarify the concept of total (and, in the court's view, categorically compensable) taking on which it rests, a concept which the court describes, see ante, at 1016-1017, n. 6, as so uncertain under existing law as to have fostered inconsistent pronouncements by the court itself. because that concept is left uncertain, so is the significance of the exceptions to the compensation requirement that the court proceeds to recognize. this alone is enough to show that there is little utility in attempting to deal with this case on the merits. the imprudence of proceeding to the merits in spite of these unpromising circumstances is underscored by the fact that, in doing so, the court cannot help but assume something about the scope of the uncertain concept of total deprivation, even when it is barred from explicating total deprivation directly. thus, when the court concludes that the application of nuisance law provides an exception to the general rule that complete denial of economically beneficial use of property amounts to a compensable taking, the court will be understood to suggest (if it does not assume) that there are in fact circumstances in which state-law nuisance abatement may amount to a denial of all beneficial land use as that concept is to be employed in our takings jurisprudence under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. the nature of nuisance law, however, indicates that application of a regulation defensible on grounds of nuisance prevention or abatement will quite probably not amount to a complete deprivation in fact. the nuisance enquiry focuses on conduct, not on the character of the property on which that conduct is performed, see 4 restatement (second) of torts  821b (1979) (public nuisance); id.,  822 (private nuisance), and the remedies for such conduct usually leave the property owner with other reasonable uses of his property, see w. keeton, d. dobbs, r. keeton,  d. owen, prosser and keeton on law of torts  90 (5th ed. 1984) (public nuisances usually remedied by criminal prosecution or abatement), id.,  89 (private nuisances usually remedied by damages, injunction, or abatement); see also, e. g., mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623, 668 669 (1887) (prohibition on use of property to manufacture intoxicating beverages ""does not disturb the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by the state that its use    for certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests""); hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394, 412 (1915) (prohibition on operation of brickyard did not prohibit extraction of clay from which bricks were produced). indeed, it is difficult to imagine property that can be used only to create a nuisance, such that its sole economic value must presuppose the right to occupy it for such seriously noxious activity. the upshot is that the issue of what constitutes a total deprivation is being addressed by indirection, and with uncertain results, in the court's treatment of defenses to compensation claims. while the issue of what constitutes total deprivation deserves the court's attention, as does the relationship between nuisance abatement and such total deprivation, the court should confront these matters directly. because it can neither do so in this case, nor skip over those preliminary issues and deal independently with defenses to the court's categorical compensation rule, the court should dismiss the instant writ and await an opportunity to face the total deprivation question squarely. under these circumstances, i believe it proper for me to vote to dismiss the writ, despite the court's contrary preference. see, e. g., welsh v. wisconsin, 466 u. s. 740, 755 (1984) (burger, c. j.);

id., at 156 (asking ""damages for the temporary taking of his property"" from the date of the 1988 act's passage to ""such time as this matter is finally resolved""). no more can reasonably be demanded. cf. first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304, 312-313 (1987). justice blackmun finds it""baffling,"" post, at 1043, n.5, that we grant standing here, whereas ""just a few days ago, in lujan v. defenders of wildlife, 504 u. s. 555 (1992),"" we denied standing. he sees in that strong evidence to support his repeated imputations that the court ""presses"" to take this case, post, at 1036, is ""eager to decide"" it, post, at 1045, and is unwilling to ""be denied,"" post, at 1042. he has a point: the decisions are indeed very close in time, yet one grants standing and the other denies it. the distinction, however, rests in law rather than chronology. lujan, since it involved the establishment of injury in fact at the summary judgment stage, required specific facts to be adduced by sworn testimony; had the same challenge to a generalized allegation of injury in fact been made at the pleading stage, it would have been unsuccessful. in that case, the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reached the merits of a takings challenge to the 1988 beachfront management act identical to the one lucas brings here even though the act was amended, and the special permit procedure established, while the case was under submission. the court observed:the enactment of the 1990 act during the pendency of this appeal, with its provisions for special permits and other changes that may affect the plaintiffs, does not relieve us of the need to address the plaintiffs' claims under the provisions of the 1988 act. even if the amended act cured all of the plaintiffs' concerns, the amendments would not foreclose the possibility that a taking had occurred during the years when the 1988 act was in effect.esposito v. south carolina coastal council, 939 f. 2d 165, 168 (1991). justice blackmun states that our ""intense interest in lucas' plight.   would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment below and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments"" to the beachfront management act. post, at 1045, n. 7. that is a strange suggestion, given that the south carolina supreme court rendered its categorical disposition in this case after the act had been amended, and after it had been invited to consider the effect of those amendments on lucas's case. we have no reason to believe that the justices of the south carolina supreme court are any more desirous of using a narrower ground now than they were then; and neither ""prudence"" nor any other principle of judicial restraint requires that we remand to find out whether they have changed their mind. we will not attempt to respond to all of justice blackmun's mistaken citation of case precedent. characteristic of its nature is his assertion that the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition ""that proof that a regulation does not deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge"" and not for the point that ""denial of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration."" post, at 1050, n. 11. the cases say, repeatedly and unmistakably, that ""`he test to be applied in considering facial challenge is fairly straightforward. a statute regulating the uses that can be made of property effects a taking if it ""denies an owner economically viable use of his land. ""`  keystone, 480 u. s., at 495 (quoting hodel, 452 u. s., at 295-296 (quoting agins, 447 u. s., at 260)) (emphasis added). justice blackmun describes that rule (which we do not invent but merely apply today) as ""alter the long-settled rules of review"" by foisting on the state ""the burden of showing regulation is not a taking."" post, at 1045, 1046. this is of course wrong. lucas had to do more than simply file a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement; he had to show that the beachfront management act denied him economically beneficial use of his land. our analysis presumes the unconstitutionality of state land-use regulation only in the sense that any rule with exceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates itfor example, the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. see, e. g., simon  schuster, inc. v. members of n. y. state crime victims bd., 502 u. s. 105, 115 (1991) (""a statute is presumptively inconsistent with the first amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech""). justice blackmun's real quarrel is with the substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a longestablished standard we see no need to repudiate. regrettably, the rhetorical force of our ""deprivation of all economically feasible use"" rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does not make clear the ""property interest"" against which the loss of value is to be measured. when, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave 90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract as a whole. (for an extremeand, we think, unsupportableview of the relevant calculus, see penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 42 n. y. 2d 324, 333-334, 366 n. e. 2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff'd, 438 u. s. 104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel's value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total value of the takings claimant's other holdings in the vicinity.) unsurprisingly, this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our ""deprivation"" fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the court. compare pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393, 414 (1922) (law restricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis, 480 u. s. 470, 497-502 (1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id., at 515-520 (rehnquist, c. j., dissenting); rose, mahon reconstructed: why the takings issue is still a muddle, 57 s. cal. l. rev. 561, 566-569 (1984). the answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner's reasonable expectations have been shaped by the state's law of propertyi. e., whether and to what degree the state's law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. in any event, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the ""interest in land"" that lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the south carolina court of common pleas found that the beachfront management act left each of lucas's beachfront lots without economic value. justice stevens criticizes the ""deprivation of all economically beneficial use"" rule as ""wholly arbitrary,"" in that  landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing,"" while the landowner who suffers a complete elimination of value ""recovers the land's full value."" post, at 1064. this analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation. such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, ""he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and   .the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations"" are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104, 124 (1978). it is true that in at least some cases the landowner with 95% loss will get nothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. but that occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between the landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in full) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value by the highway (who recovers nothing). takings law is full of these ""allor-nothing"" situations. justice stevens similarly misinterprets our focus on ""developmental"" uses of property (the uses proscribed by the beachfront management act) as betraying an ""assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the constitution are developmental uses."" post, at 1065, n. 3. we make no such assumption. though our prior takings cases evince an abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land, there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the takings clause. see, e. g., loretto v. teleprompter manhattan catv corp., 458 u. s. 419, 436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one's land). this finding was the premise of the petition for certiorari, and since it was not challenged in the brief in opposition we decline to entertain the argument in respondent's brief on the merits, see brief for respondent 45-50, that the finding was erroneous. instead, we decide the question presented under the same factual assumptions as did the supreme court of south carolina. see oklahoma city v. tuttle, 471 u. s. 808, 816 (1985). the legislature's express findings include the following:the general assembly finds that: (1) the beach/dune system along the coast of south carolina is extremely important to the people of this state and serves the following functions: (a) protects life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economical and effective manner; (b) provides the basis for a tourism industry that generates approximately two-thirds of south carolina's annual tourism industry revenue which constitutes a significant portion of the state's economy. the tourists who come to the south carolina coast to enjoy the ocean and dry sand beach contribute significantly to state and local tax revenues; (c) provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered. waters adjacent to the beach/ dune system also provide habitat for many other marine species; (d) provides a natural health environment for the citizens of south carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental wellbeing. (2) beach/dune system vegetation is unique and extremely important to the vitality and preservation of the system. (3) many miles of south carolina's beaches have been identified as critically eroding. (4) evelopment unwisely has been sited too close to the system. this type of development has jeopardized the stability of the beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacent property. it is in both the public and private interests to protect the system from this unwise development. (5) the use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices such as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatened structures adjacent to the beach has not proven effective. these armoring devices have given a falsesense of security to beachfront property owners. in reality, these hard structures, in many instances, have increased the vulnerability of beachfront property to damage from wind and waves while contributing to the deterioration and loss of the dry sand beach which is so important to the tourism industry. (6) erosion is a natural process which becomes a significant problem for man only when structures are erected in close proximity to the beach/ dune system. it is in both the public and private interests to afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle. this space can be provided only by discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune system and encouraging those who have erected structures too close to the system to retreat from it.      (8) it is in the state's best interest to protect and to promote increased public access to south carolina's beaches for out-of-state tourists and south carolina residents alike."" s. c. code ann.  48-39-250 (supp. 1991). in the present case, in fact, some of the  legislature's `findings'  to which the south carolina supreme court purported to defer in characterizing the purpose of the act as ""harm-preventing,"" 304 s. c. 376, 385, 404 s. e. 2d 895, 900 (1991), seem to us phrased in ""benefitconferring"" language instead. for example, they describe the importance of a construction ban in enhancing ""south carolina's annual tourism industry revenue,"" s. c. code ann.  48-39-250(1)(b) (supp. 1991), in ""provid habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered,""  48-39-250(1)(c), and in ""provid a natural healthy environment for the citizens of south carolina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being,""  48-39-250(1)(d). it would be pointless to make the outcome of this case hang upon this terminology, since the same interests could readily be described in ""harm-preventing"" fashion. justice blackmun, however, apparently insists that we must make the outcome hinge (exclusively) upon the south carolina legislature's other, ""harm-preventing"" characterizations, focusing on the declaration that ""prohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary to protect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion."" post, at 1040. he says ""othing in the record undermines assessment,"" ibid., apparently seeing no significance in the fact that the statute permits owners of existing structures to remain (and even to rebuild if their structures are not ""destroyed beyond repair,"" s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(b) (supp. 1988)), and in the fact that the 1990 amendment authorizes the council to issue permits for new construction in violation of the uniform prohibition, see s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(d)(1) (supp. 1991). in justice blackmun's view, even with respect to regulations that deprive an owner of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses, the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited a harm-preventing justification for its action. see post, at 1039, 1040-1041, 1047-1051. since such a justification can be formulated in practically every case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupid staff. we think the takings clause requires courts to do more than insist upon artful harm-preventing characterizations. e. g., mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887) (prohibition upon use of a building as a brewery; other uses permitted); plymouth coal co. v. pennsylvania, 232 u. s. 531 (1914) (requirement that ""pillar"" of coal be left in ground to safeguard mine workers; mineral rights could otherwise be exploited); reinman v.little rock, 237 u. s. 171 (1915) (declaration that livery stable constituted a public nuisance; other uses of the property permitted); hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915) (prohibition of brick manufacturing in residential area; other uses permitted); goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590 (1962) (prohibition on excavation; other uses permitted). drawing on our first amendment jurisprudence, see, e. g., employment div., dept. of human resources of ore. v. smith, 494 u. s. 872, 878-879 (1990), justice stevens would ""loo to the generality of a regulation of property"" to determine whether compensation is owing. post, at 1072. the beach front management act is general, in his view, because it ""regulates the use of the coastline of the entire state."" post, at 1074. there may be some validity to the principle justice stevens proposes, but it does not properly apply to the present case. the equivalent of a law of general application that inhibits the practice of religion without being aimed at religion, see oregon v. smith, supra  is a law that destroys the value of land without being aimed at land. perhaps such a law  the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturing of alcoholic beverages challenged in mugler comes to mind  cannot constitute a compensable taking. see 123 u. s., at 655-656. but a regulation specifically directed to land use no more acquires immunity by plundering landowners generally than does a law specifically directed at religious practice acquire immunity by prohibiting all religions. justice stevens's approach renders the takings clause little more than a particularized restatement of the equal protection clause. after accusing us of ""launch a missile to kill a mouse,"" post, at 1036, justice blackmun expends a good deal of throw-weight of his own upon a noncombatant, arguing that our description of the ""understanding"" of land ownership that informs the takings clause is not supported by early american experience. that is largely true, but entirely irrelevant. the practices of the states prior to incorporation of the takings and just compensation clauses, see chicago, b.  q. r. co. v. chicago  166 u. s. 226 (1897)  which, as justice blackmun acknowledges, occasionally included outright physical appropriation of land without compensation, see post, at 1056  were out of accord with any plausible interpretation of those provisions. justice blackmun is correct that early constitutional theorists did not believe the takings clause embraced regulations of property at all, see post, at 1057-1058, and n. 23, but even he does not suggest (explicitly, at least) that we renounce the court's contrary conclusion in mahon. since the text of the clause can be read to encompass regulatory as well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposed by madison, see speech proposing bill of rights (june 8, 1789), in 12 j. madison, the papers of james madison 201 (c. hobson, r. rutland, w. rachal,  j. sisson ed. 1979) (""no person shall be    obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without a just compensation""), we decline to do so as well. the principal ""otherwise"" that we have in mind is litigation absolving the state (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of ""real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire"" or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of others. bowditch v. boston, 101 u. s. 16, 18-19 (1880); see united states v. pacific r. co.  120 u. s. 227, 238-239 (1887). of course, the state may elect to rescind its regulation and thereby avoid having to pay compensation for a permanent deprivation. see first english evangelical lutheran church, 482 u. s., at 321. but ""where the already worked a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective."" ibid. justice blackmun decries our reliance on background nuisance principles at least in part because he believes those principles to be as manipulable as we find the ""harm prevention""/""benefit conferral"" dichotomy, see post, at 1054-1055. there is no doubt some leeway in a court's interpretation of what existing state law permits  but not remotely as much, we think, as in a legislative crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. we stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically beneficial uses may be defended only if an objectively reasonable application of relevant precedents would exclude those beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found. the country has come to recognize that uncontrolled beach front development can cause serious damage to life and property. see brief for sierra club et al. as amici curiae 2-5. hurricane hugo's september 1989 attack upon south carolina's coastline, for example, caused 29 deaths and approximately $6 billion in property damage, much of it the result of uncontrolled beach front development. see zalkin, shifting sands and shifting doctrines: the supreme court's changing takings doctrine and south carolina's coastal zone statute, 79 calif. l. rev. 205, 212-213 (1991). the beach front buildings are not only themselves destroyed in such a storm, ""but they are often driven, like battering rams, into adjacent inland homes."" ibid. moreover, the development often destroys the natural sand dune barriers that provide storm breaks. ibid. the setback line was determined by calculating the distance landward from the crest of an ideal oceanfront sand dune which is 40 times the annual erosion rate. s. c. code ann.  48-39-280 (supp. 1991). the properties were sold frequently at rapidly escalating prices before lucas purchased them. lot 22 was first sold in 1979 for $96,660, sold in 1984 for $187,500, then in 1985 for $260,000, and, finally, to lucas in 1986 for $475,000. he estimated its worth in 1991 at $650,000. lot 24 had a similar past. the record does not indicate who purchased the properties prior to lucas, or why none of the purchasers held on to the lots and built on them. tr. 44-46. the court's reliance, ante, at 1013, on esposito v. south carolina coastal council  939 f. 2d 165, 168 (ca4 1991), cert. denied, post, p. 1219, in support of its decision to consider lucas' temporary takings claim ripe is misplaced. in esposito the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge to the mere enactment of the act. here, of course, lucas has brought an asapplied challenge. see brief for petitioner 16. facial challenges are ripe when the act is passed; applied challenges require a final decision on the act's application to the property in question. even more baffling, given its decision, just a few days ago, in lujan v. defenders of wildlife  504 u. s. 555 (1992), the court decides petitioner has demonstrated injury in fact. in his complaint, petitioner made no allegations that he had any definite plans for using his property. app. to pet. for cert. 153-156. at trial, lucas testified that he had house plans drawn up, but that he was ""in no hurry"" to build ""because the lot was appreciating in value."" tr. 28-29. the trial court made no findings of fact that lucas had any plans to use the property from 1988 to 1990. ""`ome day' intentions  without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be  do not support a finding of the `actual or imminent' injury that our cases require."" 504 u. s., at 564. the court circumvents defenders of wildlife by deciding to resolve this case as if it arrived on the pleadings alone. but it did not. lucas had a full trial on his claim for ""`damages for the temporary taking of his property' from the date of the 1988 act's passage to `such time as this matter is finally resolved,'"" ante, at 1013, n. 3, quoting the complaint, and failed to demonstrate any immediate concrete plans to build or sell. respondent contested the findings of fact of the trial court in the south carolina supreme court, but that court did not resolve the issue. this court's decision to assume for its purposes that petitioner had been denied all economic use of his land does not, of course, dispose of the issue on remand. the court overlooks the lack of a ripe and justiciable claim apparently out of concern that in the absence of its intervention lucas will be unable to obtain further adjudication of his temporary takings claim. the court chastises respondent for arguing that lucas' temporary takings claim is premature because it failed ""so much as commen"" upon the effect of the south carolina supreme court's decision on petitioner's ability to obtain relief for the 2-year period, and it frets that lucas would ""be unable (absent our intervention now) to obtain further state-court adjudication with respect to the 1988-1990 period."" ante, at 1012. whatever the explanation for the court's intense interest in lucas' plight when ordinarily we are more cautious in granting discretionary review, the concern would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment below and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments. at that point, petitioner could have brought a temporary takings claim in the state courts. prior to mugler, the court had held that owners whose real property is wholly destroyed to prevent the spread of a fire are not entitled to compensation. bowditch v. boston  101 u. s. 16, 18-19 (1880). and the court recognized in the license cases, 5 how. 504, 589 (1847) (opinion of mclean, j.),that ""he acknowledged police power of a state extends often to the destruction of property."" that same year, an appeal came to the court asking ""hether zoning ordinances which altogether destroy the worth of valuable land by prohibiting the only economic use of which it is capable effect a taking of real property without compensation."" juris. statement, o. t. 1962, no. 307, p. 5. the court dismissed the appeal for lack of a substantial federal question. consolidated rock products co. v. los angeles  57 cal. 2d 515, 370 p. 2d 342, appeal dism'd, 371 u. s. 36 (1962). on remand, the california court found no taking in part because the zoning regulation ""involves this highest of public interests  the prevention of death and injury."" first lutheran church v. los angeles  210 cal. app. 3d 1353, 1370, 258 cal. rptr. 893, 904 (1989), cert. denied, 493 u. s. 1056 (1990). the court's suggestion that agins v. city of tiburon  447 u. s. 255 (1980), a unanimous opinion, created a new per se rule, only now discovered, is unpersuasive. in agins, the court stated that ""no precise rule determines when property has been taken"" but instead that ""the question necessarily requires a weighing of public and private interest."" id., at 260-262. the other cases cited by the court, ante, at 1015, repeat the agins sentence, but in no way suggest that the public interest is irrelevant if total value has been taken. the court has indicated that proof that a regulation does not deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge. see hodel v. virginia surface mining  reclamation assn., inc.  452 u. s. 264, 295-297 (1981). but the conclusion that a regulation is not on its face a taking because it allows the landowner some economic use of property is a far cry from the proposition that denial of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration. the court never has accepted the latter proposition. the court relies today on dicta in agins, hodel, nollan v. california coastal comm'n  483 u. s. 825 (1987), and keystone bituminous coal assn. v. debenedictis, 480 u. s. 470 (1987), for its new categorical rule. ante, at 1015-1016. i prefer to rely on the directly contrary holdings in cases such as mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s. 623 (1887), and hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915), not to mention contrary statements in the very cases on which the court relies. see agins, 447 u. s., at 260-262; keystone bituminous coal, 480 u. s., at 489, n. 18, 491-492. miller v. schoene, 276 u. s. 272 (1928), is an example. in the course of demonstrating that apple trees are more valuable than red cedar trees, the court noted that red cedar has ""occasional use and value as lumber."" id., at 279. but the court did not discuss whether the timber owned by the petitioner in that case was commercially salable, and nothing in the opinion suggests that the state's right to require uncompensated felling of the trees depended on any such salvage value. to the contrary, it is clear from its unanimous opinion that the schoene court would have sustained a law requiring the burning of cedar trees if that had been necessary to protect apple trees in which there was a public interest: the court spoke of preferment of the public interest over the property interest of the individual, ""to the extent even of its destruction."" id., at 280. the court seeks to disavow the holdings and reasoning of mugler and subsequent cases by explaining that they were the court's early efforts to define the scope of the police power. there is language in the earliest takings cases suggesting that the police power was considered to be the power simply to prevent harms. subsequently, the court expanded its understanding of what were government's legitimate interests. but it does not follow that the holding of those early cases  that harmful and noxious uses of property can be forbidden whatever the harm to the property owner and without the payment of compensation  was repudiated. to the contrary, as the court consciously expanded the scope of the police power beyond preventing harm, it clarified that there was a core of public interests that overrode any private interest. see keystone bituminous coal, 480 u. s., at 491, n. 20. ""indeed, it would be extraordinary to construe the constitution to require a government to compensate private landowners because it denied them `the right' to use property which cannot be used without risking injury and death."" first lutheran church, 210 cal. app. 3d, at 1366, 258 cal. rptr., at 901-902. although it refers to state nuisance and property law, the court apparently does not mean just any state nuisance and property law. public nuisance was first a common-law creation, see newark, the boundaries of nuisance, 65 l. q. rev. 480, 482 (1949) (attributing development of nuisance to 1535), but by the 1800's in both the united states and england, legislatures had the power to define what is a public nuisance, and particular uses often have been selectively targeted. see prosser, private action for public nuisance, 52 va. l. rev. 997, 999-1000 (1966); j. stephen, a general view of the criminal law of england 105-107 (2d ed. 1890). the court's references to ""common-law"" background principles, however, indicate that legislative determinations do not constitute ""state nuisance and property law"" for the court. also, until today the fact that the regulation prohibited uses that were lawful at the time the owner purchased did not determine the constitutional question. the brewery, the brickyard, the cedar trees, and the gravel pit were all perfectly legitimate uses prior to the passage of the regulation. see mugler v. kansas, 123 u. s., at 654; hadacheck v. sebastian, 239 u. s. 394 (1915); miller, 276 u. s., at 272; goldblatt v. hempstead, 369 u. s. 590 (1962). this court explicitly acknowledged in hadacheck that  vested interest cannot be asserted against because of conditions once obtaining. to so hold would preclude development and fix a city forever in its primitive conditions."" 239 u. s., at 410 (citation omitted). the court argues that finding no taking when the legislature prohibits a harmful use, such as the court did in mugler and the south carolina supreme court did in the instant case, would nullify pennsylvania coal. see ante, at 1022-1023. justice holmes, the author of pennsylvania coal, joined miller v. schoene, 276 u. s. 272 (1928), six years later. in miller, the court adopted the exact approach of the south carolina court: it found the cedar trees harmful, and their destruction not a taking, whether or not they were a nuisance. justice holmes apparently believed that such an approach did not repudiate his earlier opinion. moreover, this court already has been over this ground five years ago, and at that point rejected the assertion that pennsylvania coal was inconsistent with mugler, hadacheck, miller, or the others in the string of ""noxious use"" cases, recognizing instead that the nature of the state's action is critical in takings analysis. keystone bituminous coal, 480 u. s., at 490. see also michelman, property, utility, and fairness, comments on the ethical foundations of ""just compensation"" law, 80 harv. l. rev. 1165, 1192-1193 (1967); sax, takings and the police power, 74 yale l. j. 36, 60 (1964).

""the evidence certainly seems to indicate that the mere fact that government activity destroyed existing economic advantages and power did not disturb at all."" id., at 56. professor sax contends that even blackstone, ""remembered champion of the language of private property,"" did not believe that the compensation clause was meant to preserve economic value. id., at 58-59. in 1796, the attorney general of south carolina responded to property holders' demand for compensation when the state took their land to build a road by arguing that ""there is not one instance on record, and certainly none within the memory of the oldest man now living, of any demand being made for compensation for the soil or freehold of the lands."" lindsay v. commissioners, 2 s. c. l. 38, 49 (1796). only the constitutions of vermont and massachusetts required that compensation be paid when private property was taken for public use; and although eminent domain was mentioned in the pennsylvania constitution, its sole requirement was that property not be taken without the consent of the legislature. see grant, the ""higher law"" background of the law of eminent domain, in 2 selected essays on constitutional law 912, 915  916 (1938). by 1868, five of the original states still had no just compensation clauses in their constitutions. ibid. james madison, author of the takings clause, apparently intended it to apply only to direct, physical takings of property by the federal government. see treanor, the origins and original significance of the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment, 94 yale l. j. 694, 711 (1985). professor sax argues that although ""contemporaneous commentary upon the meaning of the compensation clause is in very short supply,"" 74 yale l. j., at 58, the ""few authorities that are available"" indicate that the clause was ""designed to prevent arbitrary government action,"" not to protect economic value. id., at 58-60. for this reason, the retroactive application of the regulation to formerly lawful uses was not a controlling distinction in the past. ""nor can it make any difference that the right is purchased previous to the passage of the by-law,"" for ""very right, from an absolute ownership in property, down to a mere easement, is purchased and holden subject to the restriction, that it shall be so exercised as not to injure others. though, at the time, it be remote and inoffensive, the purchaser is bound to know, at his peril, that it may become otherwise."" coates v. city of new york, 7 cow. 585, 605 (n. y. 1827). see also brick presbyterian church v. city of new york, 5 cow. 538, 542 (n. y. 1826);commonwealth v. tewksbury, 11 metc. 55 (mass. 1846); state v. paul, 5 r. i. 185 (1858). more recent state-court decisions agree. see, e. g.,lane v.mt. vernon, 38 n. y. 2d 344, 348-349, 342 n. e. 2d 571, 573 (1976); commonwealth v. baker, 160 pa. super. 640, 641-642, 53 a. 2d 829, 830 (1947). the court asserts that all early american experience, prior to and after passage of the bill of rights, and any case law prior to 1897 are ""entirely irrelevant"" in determining what is ""the historical compact recorded in the takings clause."" ante, at 1028, and n. 15. nor apparently are we to find this compact in the early federal takings cases, which clearly permitted prohibition of harmful uses despite the alleged loss of all value, whether or not the prohibition was a common-law nuisance, and whether or not the prohibition occurred subsequent to the purchase. see supra, at 1047-1048, 1052-1053, and n. 16. i cannot imagine where the court finds its ""historical compact,"" if not in history. in this regard, it is noteworthy that petitioner acquired the lot about 18 months before the statute was passed; there is no evidence that he ever sought a building permit from the local authorities. this aspect of the act was amended in 1990. see s. c. code ann.  48-39-290(b) (supp. 1990). of course, the same could easily be said in this case: lucas may put his land to ""other uses""  fishing or camping, for example  or may sell his land to his neighbors as a buffer. in either event, his land is far from ""valueless."" this highlights a fundamental weakness in the court's analysis: its failure to explain why only the impairment of ""economically beneficial or productive use,"" ante, at 1015 (emphasis added), of property is relevant in takings analysis. i should think that a regulation arbitrarily prohibiting an owner from continuing to use her property for bird watching or sunbathing might constitute a taking under some circumstances; and, conversely, that such uses are of value to the owner. yet the court offers no basis for its assumption that the only uses of property cognizable under the constitution are developmental uses. this unfortunate possibility is created by the court's subtle revision of the ""total regulatory takings"" dicta. in past decisions, we have stated that a regulation effects a taking if it ""denies an owner economically viable use of his land,  agins v. city of tiburon, 447 u. s. 255, 260 (1980) (emphasis added), indicating that this ""total takings"" test did not apply to other estates. today, however, the court suggests that a regulation may effect a total taking of any real property interest. see ante, at 1016 1017, n. 7. even measured in terms of efficiency, the court's rule is unsound. the court today effectively establishes a form of insurance against certain changes in land-use regulations. like other forms of insurance, the court's rule creates a ""moral hazard"" and inefficiencies: in the face of uncertainty about changes in the law, developers will overinvest, safe in the knowledge that if the law changes adversely, they will be entitled to compensation. see generally farber, economic analysis and just compensation, 12 int'l rev. of law  econ. 125 (1992). as the court correctly notes, in regulatory takings, unlike physical takings, courts have a choice of remedies. see ante, at 1030, n. 17. they may ""invalidat excessive regulation"" or they may ""allo the regulation to stand and orde the government to afford compensation for the permanent taking."" first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale v. county of los angeles, 482 u. s. 304, 335 (1987) (stevens, j., dissenting); see also id., at 319-321. in either event, however, the costs to the government are likely to be substantial and are therefore likely to impede the development of sound land-use policy. this principle of generality is well rooted in our broader understandings of the constitution as designed in part to control the ""mischiefs of faction."" see the federalist no. 10, p. 43 (g. wills ed. 1982) (j. madison). an analogous concern arises in first amendment law. there we have recognized that an individual's rights are not violated when his religious practices are prohibited under a neutral law of general applicability. for example, in employment div.,dept. of human resources of ore. v. smith, 494 u. s. 872, 879-880 (1990), we observed: decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a `valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).' united states v. lee, 455 u. s. 252, 263, n. 3 (1982) (stevens, j., concurring in judgment).    in prince v. massachusetts, 321 u. s. 158 (1944), we held that a mother could be prosecuted under the child labor laws for using her children to dispense literature in the streets, her religious motivation notwithstanding. we found no constitutional infirmity in `excluding from doing there what no other children may do.' id., at 171. in braunfeld v. brown, 366 u. s. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion), we upheld sunday-closing laws against the claim that they burdened the religious practices of persons whose religions compelled them to refrain from work on other days. in gillette v. united states, 401 u. s. 437, 461 (1971), we sustained the military selective service system against the claim that it violated free exercise by conscripting persons who opposed a particular war on religious grounds.if such a neutral law of general applicability may severely burden constitutionally protected interests in liberty, a comparable burden on property owners should not be considered unreasonably onerous. see levmore, takings, torts, and special interests, 77 va. l. rev. 1333, 1352-1354 (1991). see zalkin, shifting sands and shifting doctrines: the supreme court's changing takings doctrine and south carolina's coastal zone statute, 79 calif. l. rev. 205, 216-217, nn. 46-47 (1991) (collecting statutes). this provision was amended in 1990. see s. c. code ann.  48-39 290(b) (supp. 1990). this provision was amended in 1990; authority for renourishment was shifted to local governments. see s. c. code ann.  48-39-350(a) (supp. 1990). in this regard, the act more closely resembles the subsidence act in keystone than the kohler act in pennsylvania coal co. v. mahon, 260 u. s. 393 (1922), and more closely resembles the general zoning scheme in euclid v.amber realty co., 272 u. s. 365 (1926), than the specific landmark designation in penn central transportation co. v. new york city, 438 u. s. 104 (1978). zalkin, 79 calif. l. rev., at 212-213.embed"

9,"i have had the honor to be appointed by your committee to the trying task of reading the williams' lecture on murder, considered as one of the fine arts; a task which might be easy enough three or four centuries ago, when the art was little understood, and few great models had been exhibited; but in this age, when masterpieces of excellence have been xecuted by professional mn, it must be evident, that in the style of criticism applied to them, the public will look for something of a corresponding improvement. practice and theory must advance pari passu. people begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killeda knifea purseand a dark lane. design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry, sentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature. mr. williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us; and to me, therefore, in particular, has deepened the arduousness of my task. like schylus or milton in poetry, like michael angelo in painting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity; and, as mr. wordsworth observes, has in a manner ""created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed."" to sketch the history of the art, and to examine its principles critically, now remains as a duty for the connoisseur, and for judges of quite another stamp from his majesty's judges of assize. before i begin, let me say a word or two to certain prigs, who affect to speak of our society as if it were in some degree immoral in its tendency. immoral! god bless my soul, gentlemen, what is it that people mean? i am for morality, and always shall be, and for virtue and all that; and i do affirm, and always shall, (let what will come of it,) that murder is an improper line of conduct, highly improper; and i do not stick to assert, that any man who deals in murder, must have very incorrect ways of thinking, and truly inaccurate principles; and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victim's hiding-place, as a great moralist of germany declared it to be every good man's duty to do. i would subscribe one shilling and sixpence to have him apprehended, which is more by eighteen-pence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for that purpose. but what then? everything in this world has two handles. murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle, (as it generally is in the pulpit, and at the old bailey;) and that, i confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated sthetically, as the germans call it, that is, in relation to good taste. to illustrate this, i will urge the authority of three eminent persons, viz., s.t. coleridge, aristotle, and mr. howship the surgeon. to begin with s.t.c. one night, many years ago, i was drinking tea with him in berners' street, (which, by the way, for a short street, has been uncommonly fruitful in men of genius.) others were there besides myself; and amidst some carnal considerations of tea and toast, we were all imbibing a dissertation on plotinus from the attic lips of s.t.c. suddenly a cry arose of ""firefire!"" upon which all of us, master and disciples, plato and  rushed out, eager for the spectacle. the fire was in oxford street, at a piano-forte maker's; and, as it promised to be a conflagration of merit, i was sorry that my engagements forced me away from mr. coleridge's party before matters were come to a crisis. some days after, meeting with my platonic host, i reminded him of the case, and begged to know how that very promising exhibition had terminated. ""oh, sir,"" said he, ""it turned out so ill, that we damned it unanimously."" now, does any man suppose that mr. coleridge,who, for all he is too fat to be a person of active virtue, is undoubtedly a worthy christian,that this good s. t. c., i say, was an incendiary, or capable of wishing any ill to the poor man and his piano-fortes (many of them, doubtless, with the additional keys)? on the contrary, i know him to be that sort of man, that i durst stake my life upon it he would have worked an engine in a case of necessity, although rather of the fattest for such fiery trials of his virtue. but how stood the case? virtue was in no request. on the arrival of the fire-engines, morality had devolved wholly on the insurance office. this being the case, he had a right to gratify his taste. he had left his tea. was he to have nothing in return? i contend that the most virtuous man, under the premises stated, was entitled to make a luxury of the fire, and to hiss it, as he would any other performance that raised expectations in the public mind, which afterwards it disappointed. again, to cite another great authority, what says the stagyrite? he (in the fifth book, i think it is, of his metaphysics) describes what he calls  i.e., a perfect thief; and, as to mr. howship, in a work of his on indigestion, he makes no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he had seen, and which he styles ""a beautiful ulcer."" now will any man pretend, that, abstractedly considered, a thief could appear to aristotle a perfect character, or that mr. howship could be enamored of an ulcer? aristotle, it is well known, was himself so very moral a character, that, not content with writing his nichomachean ethics, in one volume octavo, he also wrote another system, called magna moralia, or big ethics. now, it is impossible that a man who composes any ethics at all, big or little, should admire a thief per se, and, as to mr. howship, it is well known that he makes war upon all ulcers; and, without suffering himself to be seduced by their charms, endeavors to banish them from the county of middlesex. but the truth is, that, however objectionable per se, yet, relatively to others of their class, both a thief and an ulcer may have infinite degrees of merit. they are both imperfections, it is true; but to be imperfect being their essence, the very greatness of their imperfection becomes their perfection. spartam nactus es, hunc exorna. a thief like autolycus or mr. barrington, and a grim phagednic ulcer, superbly defined, and running regularly through all its natural stages, may no less justly be regarded as ideals after their kind, than the most faultless moss-rose amongst flowers, in its progress from bud to ""bright consummate flower;"" or, amongst human flowers, the most magnificent young female, apparelled in the pomp of womanhood. and thus not only the ideal of an inkstand may be imagined, (as mr. coleridge demonstrated in his celebrated correspondence with mr. blackwood,) in which, by the way, there is not so much, because an inkstand is a laudable sort of thing, and a valuable member of society; but even imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state. really, gentlemen, i beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time, and now let me apply it. when a murder is in the paulo-post-futurum tense, and a rumor of it comes to our ears, by all means let us treat it morally. but suppose it over and done, and that you can say of it,, or (in that adamantine molossus of medea)  suppose the poor murdered man to be out of his pain, and the rascal that did it off like a shot, nobody knows whither; suppose, lastly, that we have done our best, by putting out our legs to trip up the fellow in his flight, but all to no purpose""abiit, evasit,"" &c.why, then, i say, what's the use of any more virtue? enough has been given to morality; now comes the turn of taste and the fine arts. a sad thing it was, no doubt, very sad; but we can't mend it. therefore let us make the best of a bad matter; and, as it is impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purposes, let us treat it sthetically, and see if it will turn to account in that way. such is the logic of a sensible man, and what follows? we dry up our tears, and have the satisfaction, perhaps, to discover that a transaction, which, morally considered, was shocking, and without a leg to stand upon, when tried by principles of taste, turns out to be a very meritorious performance. thus all the world is pleased; the old proverb is justified, that it is an ill wind which blows nobody good; the amateur, from looking bilious and sulky, by too close an attention to virtue, begins to pick up his crumbs, and general hilarity prevails. virtue has had her day; and henceforward, vertu and connoisseurship have leave to provide for themselves. upon this principle, gentlemen, i propose to guide your studies, from cain to mr. thurtell. through this great gallery of murder, therefore, together let us wander hand in hand, in delighted admiration, while i endeavor to point your attention to the objects of profitable criticism. of germany declared it to be every good man's duty to do, i would subscribe one shilling and sixpense to have him apprehended, which is more by eighteen-pence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for that purpose. but what then? everything in this world has two handles. murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle, (as it generally is in the pulpit, and at the old bailey;) and that, i confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated sthetically, as the germans call it, that is, in relation to good taste.      the first murder is familiar to you all. as the inventor of murder, and the father of the art, cain must have been a man of first-rate genius. all the cains were men of genius. tubal cain invented tubes, i think, or some such thing. but, whatever were the originality and genius of the artist, every art was then in its infancy, and the works must be criticised with a recollection of that fact. even tubal's work would probably be little approved at this day in sheffield; and therefore of cain (cain senior, i mean,) it is no disparagement to say, that his performance was but so so. milton, however, is supposed to have thought differently. by his way of relating the case, it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him, for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect: whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk'd, smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale, groan'd out his soul with gushing blood effus'd. par. lost, b. xi. upon this, richardson, the painter, who had an eye for effect, remarks as follows, in his notes on paradise lost, p. 497: ""it has been thought,"" says he, ""that cain beat (as the common saying is) the breath out of his brother's body with a great stone; milton gives in to this, with the addition, however, of a large wound."" in this place it was a judicious addition; for the rudeness of the weapon, unless raised and enriched by a warm, sanguinary coloring, has too much of the naked air of the savage school; as if the deed were perpetrated by a polypheme without science, premeditation, or anything but a mutton bone. however, i am chiefly pleased with the improvement, as it implies that milton was an amateur. as to shakspeare, there never was a better; as his description of the murdered duke of gloucester, in henry vi., of duncan's, banquo's, &c., sufficiently proves. the foundation of the art having been once laid, it is pitiable to see how it slumbered without improvement for ages. in fact, i shall now be obliged to leap over all murders, sacred and profane, as utterly unworthy of notice, until long after the christian era. greece, even in the age of pericles, produced no murder of the slightest merit; and rome had too little originality of genius in any of the arts to succeed, where her model failed her. in fact, the latin language sinks under the very idea of murder. ""the man was murdered;""how will this sound in latin? interfectus est, interemptus estwhich simply expresses a homicide; and hence the christian latinity of the middle ages was obliged to introduce a new word, such as the feebleness of classic conceptions never ascended to. murdratus est, says the sublimer dialect of gothic ages. meantime, the jewish, school of murder kept alive whatever was yet known in the art, and gradually transferred it to the western world. indeed the jewish school was always respectable, even in the dark ages, as the case of hugh of lincoln shows, which was honored with the approbation of chaucer, on occasion of another performance from the same school, which he puts into the mouth of the lady abbess. recurring, however, for one moment to classical antiquity, i cannot but think that catiline, clodius, and some of that coterie, would have made first-rate artists; and it is on all accounts to be regretted, that the priggism of cicero robbed his country of the only chance she had for distinction in this line. as the subject of a murder, no person could have answered better than himself. lord! how he would have howled with panic, if he had heard cethegus under his bed. it would have been truly diverting to have listened to him; and satisfied i am, gentlemen, that he would have preferred the utile of creeping into a closet, or even into a cloaca, to the honestum of facing the bold artist. to come now to the dark ages(by which we, that speak with precision, mean, par excellence, the tenth century, and the times immediately before and after)these ages ought naturally to be favorable to the art of murder, as they were to church architecture, to stained glass, &c.; and, accordingly, about the latter end of this period, there arose a great character in our art, i mean the old man of the mountains. he was a shining light, indeed, and i need not tell you, that the very word ""assassin"" is deduced from him. so keen an amateur was he, that on one occasion, when his own life was attempted by a favorite assassin, he was so much pleased with the talent shown, that notwithstanding the failure of the artist, he created him a duke upon the spot, with remainder to the female line, and settled a pension on him for three lives. assassination is a branch of the art which demands a separate notice; and i shall devote an entire lecture to it. meantime, i shall only observe how odd it is, that this branch of the art has flourished by fits. it never rains, but it pours. our own age can boast of some fine specimens; and, about two centuries ago, there was a most brilliant constellation of murders in this class. i need hardly say, that i allude especially to those five splendid works,the assassinations of william i, of orange, of henry iv., of france, of the duke of buckingham, (which you will find excellently described in the letters published by mr. ellis, of the british museum,) of gustavus adolphus, and of wallenstein. the king of sweden's assassination, by the by, is doubted by many writers, harte amongst others; but they are wrong. he was murdered; and i consider his murder unique in its excellence; for he was murdered at noon-day, and on the field of battle,a feature of original conception, which occurs in no other work of art that i remember. indeed, all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur. they are all of them exemplaria, of which one may say, nociurn versat manu, versate diurne; especially nocturn. in these assassinations of princes and statesmen, there is nothing to excite our wonder; important changes often depend on their deaths; and, from the eminence on which they stand, they are peculiarly exposed to the aim of every artist who happens to be possessed by the craving for scenical effect. but there is another class of assassinations, which has prevailed from an early period of the seventeenth century, that really does surprise me; i mean the assassination of philosophers. for, gentlemen, it is a fact, that every philosopher of eminence for the two last centuries has either been murdered, or, at the least, been very near it; insomuch, that if a man calls himself a philosopher, and never had his life attempted, rest assured there is nothing in him; and against locke's philosophy in particular, i think it an unanswerable objection (if we needed any), that, although he carried his throat about with him in this world for seventy-two years, no man ever condescended to cut it. as these cases of philosophers are not much known, and are generally good and well composed in their circumstances, i shall here read an excursus on that subject, chiefly by way of showing my own learning. the first great philosopher of the seventeenth century (if we except galileo) was des cartes; and if ever one could say of a man that he was all but murderedmurdered within an inchone must say it of him. the case was this, as reported by baillet in his vie de m. des cartes, tom. i. p. 102-3. in the year 1621, when des cartes might be about twenty-six years old, he was touring about as usual, (for he was as restless as a hyna,) and, coming to the elbe, either at gluckstadt or at hamburgh, he took shipping for east friezland: what he could want in east friezland no man has ever discovered; and perhaps he took this into consideration himself; for, on reaching embden, he resolved to sail instantly for west friezland; and being very impatient of delay, he hired a bark, with a few mariners to navigate it. no sooner had he got out to sea than he made a pleasing discovery, viz. that he had shut himself up in a den of murderers. his crew, says m. baillet, he soon found out to be ""des sclrats,""not amateurs, gentlemen, as we are, but professional menthe height of whose ambition at that moment was to cut his throat. but the story is too pleasing to be abridged; i shall give it, therefore, accurately, from the french of his biographer: ""m. des cartes had no company but that of his servant, with whom he was conversing in french. the sailors, who took him for a foreign merchant, rather than a cavalier, concluded that he must have money about him. accordingly they came to a resolution by no means advantageous to his purse. there is this difference, however, between sea-robbers and the robbers in forests, that the latter may, without hazard, spare the lives of their victims; whereas the other cannot put a passenger on shore in such a case without running the risk of being apprehended. the crew of m. des cartes arranged their measures with a view to evade any danger of that sort. they observed that he was a stranger from a distance, without acquaintance in the country, and that nobody would take any trouble to inquire about him, in case he should never come to hand, (quand il viendroit  manquer."") think, gentlemen, of these friezland dogs discussing a philosopher as if he were a puncheon of rum. ""his temper, they remarked, was very mild and patient; and, judging from the gentleness of his deportment, and the courtesy with which he treated themselves, that he could be nothing more than some green young man, they concluded that they should have all the easier task in disposing of his life. they made no scruple to discuss the whole matter in his presence, as not supposing that he understood any other language than that in which he conversed with his servant; and the amount of their deliberation wasto murder him, then to throw him into the sea, and to divide his spoils."" excuse my laughing, gentlemen, but the fact is, i always do laugh when i think of this casetwo things about it seem so droll. one, is, the horrid panic or ""funk,"" (as the men of eton call it,) in which des cartes must have found himself upon hearing this regular drama sketched for his own deathfuneralsuccession and administration to his effects. but another thing, which seems to me still more funny about this affair is, that if these friezland hounds had been ""game,"" we should have no cartesian philosophy; and how we could have done without that, considering the worlds of books it has produced, i leave to any respectable trunk-maker to declare. however, to go on; spite of his enormous funk, des cartes showed fight, and by that means awed these anti-cartesian rascals. ""finding,"" says m. baillet, ""that the matter was no joke, m. des cartes leaped upon his feet in a trice, assumed a stern countenance that these cravens had never looked for, and addressing them in their own language, threatened to run them through on the spot if they dared to offer him any insult."" certainly, gentlemen, this would have been an honor far above the merits of such inconsiderable rascalsto be spitted like larks upon a cartesian sword; and therefore i am glad m. des cartes did not rob the gallows by executing his threat, especially as he could not possibly have brought his vessel to port, after he had murdered his crew; so that he must have continued to cruise for ever in the zuyder zee, and would probably have been mistaken by sailors for the flying dutchman, homeward bound. ""the spirit which m. des cartes manifested,"" says his biographer, ""had the effect of magic on these wretches. the suddenness of their consternation struck their minds with a confusion which blinded them to their advantage, and they conveyed him to his destination as peaceably as he could desire."" possibly, gentlemen, you may fancy that, on the model of csar's address to his poor ferryman,""csarem vehis et fortunas ejus""m. des cartes needed only to have said,""dogs, you cannot cut my throat, for you carry des cartes and his philosophy,"" and might safely have defied them to do their worst. a german emperor had the same notion, when, being cautioned to keep out of the way of a cannonading, he replied, ""tut! man. did you ever hear of a cannon-ball that killed an emperor?"" as to an emperor i cannot say, but a less thing has sufficed to smash a philosoper; and the next great philosopher of europe undoubtedly was murdered. this was spinosa. i know very well the common opinion about him is, that he died in his bed. perhaps he did, but he was murdered for all that; and this i shall prove by a book published at brussels, in the year 1731, entitled, la via de spinosa; par m. jean colerus, with many additions, from a ms. life, by one of his friends. spinosa died on the 21st february, 1677, being then little more than forty-four years old. this of itself looks suspicious; and m. jean admits, that a certain expression in the ms. life of him would warrant the conclusion, ""que sa mort n'a pas t tout--fait naturelle."" living in a damp country, and a sailor's country, like holland, he may be thought to have indulged a good deal in grog, especially in punch, which was then newly discovered. undoubtedly he might have done so; but the fact is that he did not. m. jean calls him ""extrmement sobre en son boire et en son manger."" and though some wild stories were afloat about his using the juice of mandragora (p. 140,) and opium, (p. 144,) yet neither of these articles appeared in his druggist's bill. living, therefore, with such sobriety, how was it possible that he should die a natural death at forty-four? hear his biographer's account:""sunday morning the 21st of february, before it was church time, spinosa came down stairs and conversed with the master and mistress of the house."" at this time, therefore, perhaps ten o'clock on sunday morning, you see that spinosa was alive, and pretty well. but it seems ""he had summoned from amsterdam a certain physician, whom,"" says the biographer, ""i shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two letters, l.m. this l.m. had directed the people of the house to purchase an ancient cock, and to have him boiled forthwith, in order that spinosa might take some broth about noon, which in fact he did, and ate some of the old cock with a good appetite, after the landlord and his wife had returned from church. ""in the afternoon, l.m. staid alone with spinosa, the people of the house having returned to church; on coming out from which they learnt, with much surprise, that spinosa had died about three o'clock, in the presence of l.m., who took his departure for amsterdam the same evening, by the night-boat, without paying the least attention to the deceased. no doubt he was the readier to dispense with these duties, as he had possessed himself of a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver, together with a silver-hafted knife, and had absconded with his pillage."" here you see, gentlemen, the murder is plain, and the manner of it. it was l.m. who murdered spinosa for his money. poor s. was an invalid, meagre, and weak: as no blood was observed, l.m., no doubt, threw him down and smothered him with pillows,the poor man being already half suffocated by his infernal dinner. but who was l.m.? it surely never could be lindley murray; for i saw him at york in 1825; and besides, i do not think he would do such a thing; at least, not to a brother grammarian: for you know, gentlemen, that spinosa wrote a very respectable hebrew grammar. hobbes, but why, or on what principle, i never could understand, was not murdered. this was a capital oversight of the professional men in the seventeenth century; because in every light he was a fine subject for murder, except, indeed, that he was lean and skinny; for i can prove that he had money, and (what is very funny,) he had no right to make the least resistance; for, according to himself, irresistible power creates the very highest species of right, so that it is rebellion of the blackest die to refuse to be murdered, when a competent force appears to murder you. however, gentlemen, though he was not murdered, i am happy to assure you that (by his own account) he was three times very near being murdered. the first time was in the spring of 1640, when he pretends to have circulated a little ms. on the king's behalf, against the parliament; he never could produce this ms., by the by; but he says that, ""had not his majesty dissolved the parliament,"" (in may,) ""it had brought him into danger of his life."" dissolving the parliament, however, was of no use; for, in november of the same year, the long parliament assembled, and hobbes, a second time, fearing he should be murdered, ran away to france. this looks like the madness of john dennis, who thought that louis xiv. would never make peace with queen anne, unless he were given up to his vengeance; and actually ran away from the sea-coast in that belief. in france, hobbes managed to take care of his throat pretty well for ten years; but at the end of that time, by way of paying court to cromwell, he published his leviathan. the old coward now began to ""funk"" horribly for the third time; he fancied the swords of the cavaliers were constantly at his throat, recollecting how they had served the parliament ambassadors at the hague and madrid. ""turn,"" says he, in his dog-latin life of himself, ""tum venit in mentem mihi dorislaus et ascham; tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat."" and accordingly he ran home to england. now, certainly, it is very true that a man deserved a cudgelling for writing leviathan; and two or three cudgellings for writing a pentameter ending so villanously as""terror ubique aderat!"" but no man ever thought him worthy of anything beyond cudgelling. and, in fact, the whole story is a bounce of his own. for, in a most abusive letter which he wrote ""to a learned person,"" (meaning wallis the mathematician,) he gives quite another account of the matter, and says (p. 8,) he ran home ""because he would not trust his safety with the french clergy;"" insinuating that he was likely to be murdered for his religion, which would have been a high joke indeedtom's being brought to the stake for religion. bounce or not bounce, however, certain it is, that hobbes, to the end of his life, feared that somebody would murder him. this is proved by the story i am going to tell you: it is not from a manuscript, but, (as mr. coleridge says,) it is as good as manuscript; for it comes from a book now entirely forgotten, viz., ""the creed of mr. hobbes examined; in a conference between him and a student in divinity,"" (published about ten years before hobbes's death.) the book is anonymous, but it was written by tennison, the same who, about thirty years after, succeeded tillotson as archbishop of canterbury. the introductory anecdote is as follows: ""a certain divine, it seems, (no doubt tennison himself,) took an annual tour of one month to different parts of the island. in one of these excursions (1670) he visited the peak in derbyshire, partly in consequence of hobbes's description of it. being in that neighborhood, he could not but pay a visit to buxton; and at the very moment of his arrival, he was fortunate enough to find a party of gentlemen dismounting at the inn door, amongst whom was a long thin fellow, who turned out to be no less a person than mr. hobbes, who probably had ridden over from chattsworth. meeting so great a lion,a tourist, in search of the picturesque, could do no less than present himself in the character of bore. and luckily for this scheme, two of mr. hobbes's companions were suddenly summoned away by express; so that, for the rest of his stay at buxton, he had leviathan entirely to himself, and had the honor of bowsing with him in the evening. hobbes, it seems, at first showed a good deal of stiffness, for he was shy of divines; but this wore off, and he became very sociable and funny, and they agreed to go into the bath together. how tennison could venture to gambol in the same water with leviathan, i cannot explain; but so it was: they frolicked about like two dolphins, though hobbes must have been as old as the hills; and ""in those intervals wherein they abstained from swimming and plunging themselves,"" ""they discoursed of many things relating to the baths of the ancients, and the origine of springs. when they had in this manner passed away an hour, they stepped out of the bath; and, having dried and cloathed themselves, they sate down in expectation of such a supper as the place afforded; designing to refresh themselves like the deipnosophil, and rather to reason than to drink profoundly. but in this innocent intention they were interrupted by the disturbance arising from a little quarrel, in which some of the ruder people in the house were for a short time engaged. at this mr. hobbes seemed much concerned, though he was at some distance from the persons."" and why was he concerned, gentlemen? no doubt you fancy, from, some benign and disinterested love of peace and harmony, worthy of an old man and a philosopher. but listen""for a while he was not composed, but related it once or twice as to himself, with a low and careful tone, how sextus roscius was murthered after supper by the balne palatin. of such general extent is that remark of cicero, in relation to epicurus the atheist, of whom he observed that he of all men dreaded most those things which he contemneddeath and the gods."" merely because it was supper time, and in the neighborhood of a bath, mr. hobbes must have the fate of sextus roscius. what logic was there in this, unless to a man who was always dreaming of murder? here was leviathan, no longer afraid of the daggers of english cavaliers or french clergy, but ""frightened from his propriety"" by a row in an ale-house between some honest clod-hoppers of derbyshire, whom his own gaunt scare-crow of a person that belonged to quite another century, would have frightened out of their wits. malebranche, it will give you pleasure to hear, was murdered. the man who murdered him is well known: it was bishop berkeley. the story is familiar, though hitherto not put in a proper light. berkeley, when a young man, went to paris and called on pre malebranche. he found him in his cell cooking. cooks have ever been a genus irritabile; authors still more so: malebranche was both: a dispute arose; the old father, warm already, became warmer; culinary and metaphysical irritations united to derange his liver: he took to his bed, and died. such is the common version of the story: ""so the whole ear of denmark is abused."" the fact is, that the matter was hushed up, out of consideration for berkeley, who (as pope remarked) had ""every virtue under heaven:"" else it was well known that berkeley, feeling himself nettled by the waspishness of the old frenchman, squared at him; a turn-up was the consequence: malebranche was floored in the first round; the conceit was wholly taken out of him; and he would perhaps have given in; but berkeley's blood was now up, and he insisted on the old frenchman's retracting his doctrine of occasional causes. the vanity of the man was too great for this; and he fell a sacrifice to the impetuosity of irish youth, combined with his own absurd obstinacy. leibnitz, being every way superior to malebranche, one might, a fortiori, have counted on his being murdered; which, however, was not the case. i believe he was nettled at this neglect, and felt himself insulted by the security in which he passed his days. in no other way can i explain his conduct at the latter end of his life, when he chose to grow very avaricious, and to hoard up large sums of gold, which he kept in his own house. this was at vienna, where he died; and letters are still in existence, describing the immeasurable anxiety which he entertained for his throat. still his ambition, for being attempted at least, was so great, that he would not forego the danger. a late english pedagogue, of birmingham manufacture, viz., dr. parr, took a more selfish course, under the same circumstances. he had amassed a considerable quantity of gold and silver plate, which was for some time deposited in his bed-room at his parsonage house, hatton. but growing every day more afraid of being murdered, which he knew that he could not stand, (and to which, indeed, he never had the slightest pretension,) he transferred the whole to the hatton blacksmith; conceiving, no doubt, that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the salus reipublic, than that of a pedagogue. but i have heard this greatly disputed; and it seems now generally agreed, that one good horse-shoe is worth about 2 1/4 spital sermons. as leibnitz, though not murdered, may be said to have died, partly of the fear that he should be murdered, and partly of vexation that he was not,kant, on the other handwho had no ambition in that wayhad a narrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of, except des cartes. so absurdly does fortune throw about her favors! the case is told, i think, in an anonymous life of this very great man. for health's sake, kant imposed upon himself, at one time, a walk of six miles every day along a highroad. this fact becoming known to a man who had his private reasons for committing murder, at the third milestone from knigsberg, he waited for his ""intended,"" who came up to time as duly as a mail-coach. but for an accident, kant was a dead man. however, on considerations of ""morality,"" it happened that the murderer preferred a little child, whom he saw playing in the road, to the old transcendentalist: this child he murdered; and thus it happened that kant escaped. such is the german account of the matter; but my opinion isthat the murderer was an amateur, who felt how little would be gained to the cause of good taste by murdering an old, arid, and adust metaphysician; there was no room for display, as the man could not possibly look more like a mummy when dead, than he had done alive. thus, gentlemen, i have traced the connection between philosophy and our art, until insensibly i find that i have wandered into our own era. this i shall not take any pains to characterize apart from that which preceded it, for, in fact, they have no distinct character. the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, together with so much of the nineteenth as we have yet seen, jointly compose the augustan age of murder. the finest work of the seventeenth century is, unquestionably, the murder of sir edmondbury godfrey, which has my entire approbation. at the same time, it must be observed, that the quantity of murder was not great in this century, at least amongst our own artists; which, perhaps, is attributable to the want of enlightened patronage. sint mcenates, non deerunt, flacce, marones. consulting grant's ""observations on the bills of mortality,"" (4th edition, oxford, 1665,) i find, that out of 229,250, who died in london during one period of twenty years in the seventeenth century, not more than eighty-six were murdered; that is, about four three-tenths per annum. a small number this, gentlemen, to found an academy upon; and certainly, where the quantity is so small, we have a right to expect that the quality should be first-rate. perhaps it was; yet, still i am of opinion that the best artist in this century was not equal to the best in that which followed. for instance, however praiseworthy the case of sir edmondbury godfrey may be (and nobody can be more sensible of its merits than i am), still i cannot consent to place it on a level with that of mrs. ruscombe of bristol, either as to originality of design, or boldness and breadth of style. this good lady's murder took place early in the reign of george iii., a reign which was notoriously favorable to the arts generally. she lived in college green, with a single maid-servant, neither of them having any pretension to the notice of history but what they derived from the great artist whose workmanship i am recording. one fine morning, when all bristol was alive and in motion, some suspicion arising, the neighbors forced an entrance into the house, and found mrs. ruscombe murdered in her bed-room, and the servant murdered on the stairs: this was at noon; and, not more than two hours before, both mistress and servant had been seen alive. to the best of my remembrance, this was in 1764; upwards of sixty years, therefore, have now elapsed, and yet the artist is still undiscovered. the suspicions of posterity have settled upon two pretendersa baker and a chimney-sweeper. but posterity is wrong; no unpractised artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noon-day murder in the heart of a great city. it was no obscure baker, gentlemen, or anonymous chimney-sweeper, be assured, that executed this work. i know who it was. (here there was a general buzz, which at length broke out into open applause; upon which the lecturer blushed, and went on with much earnestness.) for heaven's sake, gentlemen, do not mistake me; it was not i that did it. i have not the vanity to think myself equal to any such achievement; be assured that you greatly overrate my poor talents; mrs. ruscombe's affair was far beyond my slender abilities. but i came to know who the artist was, from a celebrated surgeon, who assisted at his dissection. this gentleman had a private museum in the way of his profession, one corner of which was occupied by a cast from a man of remarkably fine proportions. ""that,"" said the surgeon, ""is a cast from the celebrated lancashire highwayman, who concealed his profession for some time from his neighbors, by drawing woollen stockings over his horse's legs, and in that way muffling the clatter which he must else have made in riding up a flagged alley that led to his stable. at the time of his execution for highway robbery, i was studying under cruickshank: and the man's figure was so uncommonly fine, that no money or exertion was spared to get into possession of him with the least possible delay. by the connivance of the under-sheriff he was cut down within the legal time, and instantly put into a chaise and four; so that, when he reached cruickshank's he was positively not dead. mr. , a young student at that time, had the honor of giving him the coup de grce, and finishing the sentence of the law."" this remarkable anecdote, which seemed to imply that all the gentlemen in the dissecting-room were amateurs of our class, struck me a good deal; and i was repeating it one day to a lancashire lady, who thereupon informed me, that she had herself lived in the neighborhood of that highwayman, and well remembered two circumstances, which combined, in the opinion of all his neighbors, to fix upon him the credit of mrs. ruscombe's affair. one was, the fact of his absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder: the other, that, within a very little time after, the neighborhood of this highwayman was deluged with dollars: now mrs. ruscombe was known to have hoarded about two thousand of that coin. be the artist, however, who he might, the affair remains a durable monument of his genius; for such was the impression of awe, and the sense of power left behind, by the strength of conception manifested in this murder, that no tenant (as i was told in 1810) had been found up to that time for mrs. ruscombe's house. but, whilst i thus eulogize the ruscombian case, let me not be supposed to overlook the many other specimens of extraordinary merit spread over the face of this century. such cases, indeed, as that of miss bland, or of captain donnellan, and sir theophilus boughton, shall never have any countenance from me. fie on these dealers in poison, say i: can they not keep to the old honest way of cutting throats, without introducing such abominable innovations from italy? i consider all these poisoning cases, compared with the legitimate style, as no better than wax-work by the side of sculpture, or a lithographic print by the side of a fine volpato. but, dismissing these, there remain many excellent works of art in a pure style, such as nobody need be ashamed to own, as every candid connoisseur will admit. candid, observe, i say; for great allowances must be made in these cases; no artist can ever be sure of carrying through his own fine preconception. awkward disturbances will arise; people will not submit to have their throats cut quietly; they will run, they will kick, they will bite; and whilst the portrait painter often has to complain of too much torpor in his subject, the artist, in our line, is generally embarrassed by too much animation. at the same time, however disagreeable to the artist, this tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject, is certainly one of its advantages to the world in general, which we ought not to overlook, since it favors the development of latent talent. jeremy taylor notices with admiration, the extraordinary leaps which people will take under the influence of fear. there was a striking instance of this in the recent case of the m'keands; the boy cleared a height, such as he will never clear again to his dying day. talents also of the most brilliant description for thumping, and indeed for all the gymnastic exercises, have sometimes been developed by the panic which accompanies our artists; talents else buried and hid under a bushel to the possessors, as much as to their friends. i remember an interesting illustration of this fact, in a case which i learned in germany. riding one day in the neighborhood of munich, i overtook a distinguished amateur of our society, whose name i shall conceal. this gentleman informed me that, finding himself wearied with the frigid pleasures (so he called them) of mere amateurship, he had quitted england for the continentmeaning to practise a little professionally. for this purpose he resorted to germany, conceiving the police in that part of europe to be more heavy and drowsy than elsewhere. his debut as a practitioner took place at mannheim; and, knowing me to be a brother amateur, he freely communicated the whole of his maiden adventure. ""opposite to my lodging,"" said he, ""lived a baker: he was somewhat of a miser, and lived quite alone. whether it were his great expanse of chalky face, or what else, i know notbut the fact was, i 'fancied' him, and resolved to commence business upon his throat, which by the way he always carried barea fashion which is very irritating to my desires. precisely at eight o'clock in the evening, i observed that he regularly shut up his windows. one night i watched him when thus engagedbolted in after himlocked the doorand, addressing him with great suavity, acquainted him with the nature of my errand; at the same time advising him to make no resistance, which would be mutually unpleasant. so saying, i drew out my tools; and was proceeding to operate. but at this spectacle, the baker, who seemed to have been struck by catalepsy at my first announce, awoke into tremendous agitation. 'i will not be murdered!' he shrieked aloud; 'what for will i lose my precious throat?' 'what for?' said i; 'if for no other reason, for thisthat you put alum into your bread. but no matter, alum or no alum, (for i was resolved to forestall any argument on that point,) know that i am a virtuoso in the art of murderam desirous of improving myself in its detailsand am enamored of your vast surface of throat, to which i am determined to be a customer.' 'is it so?' said he, 'but i'll find you custom in another line;' and so saying, he threw himself into a boxing attitude. the very idea of his boxing struck me as ludicrous. it is true, a london baker had distinguished himself in the ring, and became known to fame under the title of the master of the rolls; but he was young and unspoiled: whereas this man was a monstrous feather-bed in person, fifty years old, and totally out of condition. spite of all this, however, and contending against me, who am a master in the art, he made so desperate a defence, that many times i feared he might turn the tables upon me; and that i, an amateur, might be murdered by a rascally baker. what a situation! minds of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety. how severe it was, you may understand by this, that for the first thirteen rounds the baker had the advantage. round the fourteenth, i received a blow on the right eye, which closed it up; in the end, i believe, this was my salvation: for the anger it roused in me was so great that, in this and every one of the three following rounds, i floored the baker. ""round 18th. the baker came up piping, and manifestly the worse for wear. his geometrical exploits in the four last rounds had done him no good. however, he showed some skill in stopping a message which i was sending to his cadaverous mug; in delivering which, my foot slipped, and i went down. ""round 19th. surveying the baker, i became ashamed of having been so much bothered by a shapeless mass of dough; and i went in fiercely, and administered some severe punishment. a rally took placeboth went downbaker undermostten to three on amateur. ""round 20th. the baker jumped up with surprising agility; indeed, he managed his pins capitally, and fought wonderfully, considering that he was drenched in perspiration; but the shine was now taken out of him, and his game was the mere effect of panic. it was now clear that he could not last much longer. in the course of this round we tried the weaving system, in which i had greatly the advantage, and hit him repeatedly on the conk. my reason for this was, that his conk was covered with carbuncles; and i thought i should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk, which in fact i did. ""the three next rounds, the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow on the ice. seeing how matters stood, in round twenty-fourth i whispered something into his ear, which sent him down like a shot. it was nothing more than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity office. this little confidential whisper affected him greatly; the very perspiration was frozen on his face, and for the next two rounds i had it all my own way. and when i called time for the twenty-seventh round, he lay like a log on the floor."" after which, said i to the amateur, ""it may be presumed that you accomplished your purpose."" ""you are right,"" said he mildly, ""i did; and a great satisfaction, you know, it was to my mind, for by this means i killed two birds with one stone;"" meaning that he had both thumped the baker and murdered him. now, for the life of me, i could not see that; for, on the contrary, to my mind it appeared that he had taken two stones to kill one bird, having been obliged to take the conceit out of him first with his fist, and then with his tools. but no matter for his logic. the moral of his story was good, for it showed what an astonishing stimulus to latent talent is contained in any reasonable prospect of being murdered. a pursy, unwieldy, half cataleptic baker of mannheim had absolutely fought six-and-twenty rounds with an accomplished english boxer merely upon this inspiration; so greatly was natural genius exalted and sublimed by the genial presence of his murderer. really, gentlemen, when one hears of such things as these, it becomes a duty, perhaps, a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most men speak of murder. to hear people talk, you would suppose that all the disadvantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered, and that there were none at all in not being murdered. but considerate men think otherwise. ""certainly,"" says jeremy taylor, ""it is a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever: and the axe"" (to which he might have added the ship-carpenter's mallet and the crow-bar) ""a much less affliction than a strangury."" very true; the bishop talks like a wise man and an amateur, as he is; and another great philosopher, marcus aurelius, was equally above the vulgar prejudices on this subject. he declares it to be one of ""the noblest functions of reason to know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not."" (book iii., collers' translation.) no sort of knowledge being rarer than this, surely that man must be a most philanthropic character, who undertakes to instruct people in this branch of knowledge gratis, and at no little hazard to himself. all this, however, i throw out only in the way of speculation to future moralists; declaring in the meantime my own private conviction, that very few men commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principles, and repeating what i have already said once at leastthat, as to the majority of murderers, they are very incorrect characters. with respect to williams's murders, the sublimest and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed, i shall not allow myself to speak incidentally. nothing less than an entire lecture, or even an entire course of lectures, would suffice to expound their merits. but one curious fact, connected with his case, i shall mention, because it seems to imply that the blaze of his genius absolutely dazzled the eye of criminal justice. you all remember, i doubt not, that the instruments with which he executed his first great work, (the murder of the marrs,) were a ship-carpenter's mallet and a knife. now the mallet belonged to an old swede, one john petersen, and bore his initials. this instrument williams left behind him, in marr's house, and it fell into the hands of the magistrates. now, gentlemen, it is a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initials led immediately to the apprehension of williams, and, if made earlier, would have prevented his second great work, (the murder of the williamsons,) which took place precisely twelve days after. but the magistrates kept back this fact from the public for the entire twelve days, and until that second work was accomplished. that finished, they published it, apparently feeling that williams had now done enough for his fame, and that his glory was at length placed beyond the reach of accident. as to mr. thurtell's case, i know not what to say. naturally, i have every disposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society; and i acknowledge that his lectures were unexceptionable. but, speaking ingenuously, i do really think that his principal performance, as an artist, has been much overrated. i admit that at first i was myself carried away by the general enthusiasm. on the morning when the murder was made known in london, there was the fullest meeting of amateurs that i have ever known since the days of williams; old bed-ridden connoisseurs, who had got into a peevish way of sneering and complaining ""that there was nothing doing,"" now hobbled down to our club-room: such hilarity, such benign expression of general satisfaction, i have rarely witnessed. on every side you saw people shaking hands, congratulating each other, and forming dinner parties for the evening; and nothing was to be heard but triumphant challenges of""well! will this do?"" ""is this the right thing?"" ""are you satisfied at last?"" but, in the midst of this, i remember we all grew silent on hearing the old cynical amateur, l. s, that laudator temporis acti, stumping along with his wooden leg; he entered the room with his usual scowl, and, as he advanced, he continued to growl and stutter the whole way""not an original idea in the whole piecemere plagiarism,base plagiarism from hints that i threw out! besides, his style is as hard as albert durer, and as coarse as fuseli."" many thought that this was mere jealousy, and general waspishness; but i confess that, when the first glow of enthusiasm had subsided, i have found most judicious critics to agree that there was something falsetto in the style of thurtell. the fact is, he was a member of our society, which naturally gave a friendly bias to our judgments; and his person was universally familiar to the cockneys, which gave him, with the whole london public, a temporary popularity, that his pretensions are not capable of supporting; for opinionum commenta delet dies, natur judicia confirmat. there was, however, an unfinished design of thurtell's for the murder of a man with a pair of dumb-bells, which i admired greatly; it was a mere outline, that he never completed; but to my mind it seemed every way superior to his chief work. i remember that there was great regret expressed by some amateurs that this sketch should have been left in an unfinished state: but there i cannot agree with them; for the fragments and first bold outlines of original artists have often a felicity about them which is apt to vanish in the management of the details. the case of the m'keands i consider far beyond the vaunted performance of thurtell,indeed above all praise; and bearing that relation, in fact, to the immortal works of williams, which the neid bears to the iliad. but it is now time that i should say a few words about the principles of murder, not with a view to regulate your practice, but your judgment: as to old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are pleased with anything, provided it is bloody enough. but the mind of sensibility requires something more. first, then, let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer; secondly, of the place where; thirdly, of the time when, and other little circumstances. as to the person, i suppose it is evident that he ought to be a good man; because, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be contemplating murder at the very time; and such ""diamond-cut-diamond"" tussles, though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring, are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders. i could mention some people (i name no names) who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane; and so far all seemed correct enough; but, on looking farther into the matter, the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself, at the moment, planning to rob his murderer, at the least, and possibly to murder him, if he had been strong enough. whenever that is the case, or may be thought to be the case, farewell to all the genuine effects of the art. for the final purpose of murder, considered as a fine art, is precisely the same as that of tragedy, in aristotle's account of it, viz., ""to cleanse the heart by means of pity and terror."" now, terror there may be, but how can there be any pity for one tiger destroyed by another tiger? it is also evident that the person selected ought not to be a public character. for instance, no judicious artist would have attempted to murder abraham newland. for the case was this; everybody read so much about abraham newland, and so few people ever saw him, that there was a fixed belief that he was an abstract idea. and i remember that once, when i happened to mention that i had dined at a coffee-house in company with abraham newland, everybody looked scornfully at me, as though i had pretended to have played at billiards with prester john, or to have had an affair of honor with the pope. and, by the way, the pope would be a very improper person to murder: for he has such a virtual ubiquity as the father of christendom, and, like the cuckoo, is so often heard but never seen, that i suspect most people regard him also as an abstract idea. where, indeed, a public character is in the habit of giving dinners, ""with every delicacy of the season,"" the case is very different: every person is satisfied that he is no abstract idea; and, therefore, there can be no impropriety in murdering him; only that his murder will fall into the class of assassinations, which i have not yet treated. thirdly. the subject chosen ought to be in good health: for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable to bear it. on this principle, no cockney ought to be chosen who is above twenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic. or at least, if a man will hunt in that warren, he ought to murder a couple at one time; if the cockneys chosen should be tailors, he will of course think it his duty, on the old established equation, to murder eighteen. and, here, in this attention to the comfort of sick people, you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to soften and refine the feelings. the world in general, gentlemen, are very bloody-minded; and all they want in a murder is a copious effusion of blood; gaudy display in this point is enough for them. but the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste; and from our art, as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly cultivated, the result isto improve and to humanize the heart; so true is it, that ""ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes, emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."" a philosophic friend, well known for his philanthropy and general benignity, suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of young children wholly dependent on his exertions, by way of deepening the pathos. and, undoubtedly, this is a judicious caution. yet i would not insist too keenly on this condition. severe good taste unquestionably demands it; but still, where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health, i would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the effect of narrowing the artist's sphere. so much for the person. as to the time, the place, and the tools, i have many things to say, which at present i have no room for. the good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy. yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect. in respect to time, mrs. ruscombe's case is a beautiful exception, which i have already noticed; and in respect both to time and place, there is a fine exception in the annals of edinburgh, (year 1805,) familiar to every child in edinburgh, but which has unaccountably been defrauded of its due portion of fame amongst english amateurs. the case i mean is that of a porter to one of the banks, who was murdered whilst carrying a bag of money, in broad daylight, on turning out of the high street, one of the most public streets in europe, and the murderer is to this hour undiscovered. ""sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tcmpus, singula dum capti circumvectamur amore."" and now, gentlemen, in conclusion, let me again solemnly disclaim all pretensions on my own part to the character of a professional man. i never attempted any murder in my life, except in the year 1801, upon the body of a tom-cat; and that turned out differently from my intention. my purpose, i own, was downright murder. ""semper ego auditor tantum?"" said i, ""nunquamne reponam?"" and i went down stairs in search of tom at one o'clock on a dark night, with the ""animus,"" and no doubt with the fiendish looks, of a murderer. but when i found him, he was in the act of plundering the pantry of bread and other things. now this gave a new turn to the affair; for the time being one of general scarcity, when even christians were reduced to the use of potato-bread, rice-bread, and all sorts of things, it was downright treason in a tom-cat to be wasting good wheaten-bread in the way he was doing. it instantly became a patriotic duty to put him to death; and as i raised aloft and shook the glittering steel, i fancied myself rising like brutus, effulgent from a crowd of patriots, and, as i stabbed him, i ""called aloud on tully's name, and bade the father of his country hail!"" since then, what wandering thoughts i may have had of attempting the life of an ancient ewe, of a superannuated hen, and such ""small deer,"" are locked up in the secrets of my own breast; but for the higher departments of the art, i confess myself to be utterly unfit. my ambition does not rise so high. no, gentlemen, in the words of horace, ""-fungos vice cotis, excutum reddere ere qu ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi.""embed"

(talking to jay-z, who was in the studio) when i was looking once again at the jumbotron, it wasn't an r&b concert and you're on it, or it wasn't a reggae concert. it's jay-z. and i think this is such a great thing, man. it's nice to see you at the garden  transcript of hot 97, october 2003change the gameanytime you gonna make an album, especially if this is your last album, every single track has to be a statement. in your mind, you thinking, ""i have to make the perfect album.  that's what you think. anybody know me know i'm dead serious. i will sit there, drive myself crazy till i find that right track. don't waste my motherfucking time! i look at music like a puzzle. i try to figure it out. figure out what i'm gonna say on it. figure out the emotion of the track, what it's saying.the making of the black album involved some of the biggest producers in the history of the game: just blaze, who also worked on the blueprint and the dynasty: roc la familia, produced three tracks, public service announcement, interlude and december 4th. what more can i say was the first and last track that the buchanans produced for jay z before starting to work with lupe. kanye west also worked on the project, giving hova the beats for encore and lucifer while dirt off your shoulder was created by timbaland. 9th wonder put together threat from a r. kelly sample and eminem and luis resto produced moment of clarity. the neptunes and dj quik were involved with justify my thug, allure and change clothes (produced by pharrell williams). my 1st song was produced by aqua and 3h99 problems wasn't recorded in a regular studio but at rick rubin's house, the producer of the track. jay z was completely stunned by the way rubin set up his studio and the way he worked:rick ain't normal. i don't give a fuck. i know all producers have their idiosyncrasies, meaning quirks and some weird shit, but he's just strange by strange standards. while we was downstairs doing hard-core rap records and shit, upstairs he had a bunch of people who were doing some type of tibetan freedom concert planning. when was the last time you seen a bison in a nigga's studio? 99 problems turned out to be one of the biggest jay z's hits, it even brought some law professors to discuss whatever the cop had the right to inspect his car or not! the black album came out 10 years ago today, on november 14th 2003, selling 463,000 copies in his first week""we in the garden nigga""we in the garden nigga. that may not be a big deal for pop acts or rock acts. they sell out the garden a couple nights in a row. but for hip-hop, we wasn't even allowed in the building.when the day of the concert arrived, pennsylvania plaza became some sort of hip-hop red carpet; all of the big names in the scene at the time arrived at madison square garden: memphis bleek, beanie sigel, freeway, p. diddy, damon dash, r.kelly, mary j blige, foxy brown, they were all waiting for hova to take the stage the concert started with micheal buffer introducing jay z to the stage as if it was a boxing match, in the meantime, a ""roc-a-fella #1"" jersey came down from the ceiling. the notes of what more can i say started playing, jay z came out of the backstage with a biggie t-shirt and started the showafter the show ended, the audience left the garden thinking that they'd have never seen him perform live again. 3 years later he'd come out of retirement with kingdom come. in the next 7 years jay z dropped american gangster, the blueprint 3 and magna carta holy grail. hova's now holding a worldwide tour with justin timberlake, he's not wearing a biggie t-shirt anymore, he's wearing a suit. madison square garden isn't a huge deal anymore, he prefers to perform at the barclay's center, the arena in brooklyn that he partially owns. hip-hop sells out arenas around the united states on a regular basis now, and his shows sell out in a few hours jay z has come a long way since his supposed retirement in 2003, but after all he's the same old shawn.embed"

3,"names of people: the duchesse de guermantes  saint-loup at doncires  mme. de villeparisis at home  my grandmothers illness  bergottes illness  the duke and the doctor  decline and death of my grandmother. the twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to franoise. every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. in other words, we had moved. certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. now she faced even silence with a strained attention. and as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a franoise in exile. and so if i had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was so well respected on all sides and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the use of combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand i, who found it as hard to assimilate new as i found it easy to abandon old conditions, i felt myself drawn towards our old servant when i saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. she alone could understand what i was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of ones surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. and so, without giving him a thought, i went straight to franoise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. the sensibility claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. franoise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if i were in pain would turn her head from me so that i should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. it was the same as soon as i tried to speak to her about our new house. moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while i, as a result of it, had still a temperature, and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, franoise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a days journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a kings ransom, not if you were to offer her millions  a pure hypothesis  and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and usual offices) was much better fitted up in the new house. which, it is high time now that the reader should be told  and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air  was a flat forming part of the htel de guermantes. at the age when a name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which mme. de guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams. and yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy mlusine should disappear. then the name, beneath our successive restorations of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. but let a sensation from a bygone year  like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them  enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. for a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name guermantes, resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of mile. percepieds marriage, brings back to me that mauve  so delicate, almost too bright, too new  with which the billowy scarf of the young duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. and the name guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when i come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, i breathe the air of the combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. but even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name. what form was assumed in my mind by this name guermantes when my first nurse  knowing no more, probably, than i know to-day in whose honour it had been composed  sang me to sleep with that old ditty, gloire  la marquise de guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran marchal de guermantes, making my nursery-maids bosom swell with pride, stopped in the champs-elyses to remark: a fine child that! and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, i cannot, of course, now say. those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; i can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born  from the accounts given me by other people. but more recently i find in the period of that names occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. and, with mme. de guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. a dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place  right at the end of that guermantes way along which, on so many summer afternoons, i retraced with my parents the course of the vivonne  to that land of bubbling streams where the duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over france when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise notre dame of paris and notre dame of chartres, when on the summit of the hill of laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the ark of the deluge on the summit of mount ararat, crowded with patriarchs and judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of god were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of champagne; when the traveller who left beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. it was, this guermantes, like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which i could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; i recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of parnassus or of helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions  in the realm of topographical science  required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. i saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of germany, italy and france; vast territories in the north, strong cities in the south, assembled there to group themselves in guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. i had heard of the famous tapestries of guermantes, i could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, i might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in paris with mme. de guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. but then i had met saint-loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. they had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. the village of guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. as for the tapestries, they were by boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in adrianople and plush. by these revelations saint-loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. and so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding mme. de guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in paris, the htel de guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. as the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this htel de guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the duchess, but these intimates on whom i had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased. in the parties which she gave, since i could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in dresden china which was madame de guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. then, after saint-loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousins chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the htel de guermantes had become  as the louvre might have been in days gone by  a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. but this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside mme. de villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by mme. de guermantes in a wing of the htel. it was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour  whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord  is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemakers, for instance, or a tailors, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a comtesse who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porters lodge (with, by the coachmans side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porters children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same. in the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a duchess, smart and still quite young. she was, in fact, mme. de guermantes and, thanks to franoise, i soon came to know all about her household. for the guermantes (to whom franoise regularly alluded as the people below, or downstairs) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did mammas hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: look at that, now; a pair of holy sisters; thatll be for downstairs, surely; or, oh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the duke will have been out with his gun! until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: theyre having company down below; gay doings, ill be bound; whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance. but the moment in the life of the guermantes which excited the keenest interest in franoise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the duchess stepped into her carriage. it was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. for franoise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible  though by no means legible  to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. she would enlarge upon them, too, in a running aside, but not so that we could catch her words. she called this practice  which, she imagined, must be infuriating, mortifying as she herself put it,vexing to us saying low masses all the blessed day. the last rites accomplished, franoise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank her young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: come, maam, a drop more of the grape; its dlicious to-day, and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in this wretched kitchen. dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at combray. ah! combray, combray! she cried. and the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. if so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own south-country; do we not indeed constantly meet savoyards and bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the southerner? ah, combray, when shall i look on thee again, poor land! when shall i pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. and even then he makes out i dont come quick enough; youd need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if youre a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. alas, poor combray; maybe i shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. and so, nevermore shall i smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. but in the sleep of death i dare say i shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world. her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on mme. de villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in franchises affections. having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbours attention, in order to bid her good day. the coquetry of the young girl that franoise had once been softened and refined for m. jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe mammas orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her a whole chapter from the mistress. she pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: a fine pair, eh! though what she actually muttered was: what an old rattle-trap! but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout: you could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, i dare say, only you dont care for that sort of thing. and franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: tastes differ, you know; simplicitys the rule in this house, shut the window again in case mamma should come in. these you who might have had more horses than the guermantes were ourselves, but jupien was right in saying you since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, franoise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed  with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on sundays when she paid a visit to her niece  the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. and so it can be understood that franoise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my fathers claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called wearying, wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. franoises wearying had soon been cured by none other than jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. very good class, those juliens, (for franoise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) very worthy people; you can see it written on their faces. jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. this new friend of franoise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the government offices. a waistcoat-maker first of all, with the chit of a girl whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on mme. de villeparisis) had turned to ladies fashions and become a seamstress. a prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmakers workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. after this, jupiens presence in the place had ceased to matter. no doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. but with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. and so jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. he was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. his appointment to the regular establishment was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help franoise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. at the same time, and without underrating his value to franoise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, i am bound to say that my first impression of jupien had been far from favourable. at a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. there resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a royal personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. jupiens (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), i soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. the most gifted people that i had known had died young. and so i was convinced that jupiens life would soon be cut short. kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. but his part in the life of franoise had soon ceased to be indispensable. she had learned to put up with understudies. indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, franoise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for mammas answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we did not have any particular thing, it was because we had no wish for it. if she made such a point of other peoples knowing that we had money (for she knew nothing of what saint-loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply have money, fetch water), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. she distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the others attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches. as soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly  otherwise mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her every conceivable insult franoise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table. there are some guermantes who stay in the rue de la chaise, began my fathers valet; i had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. and i know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the army with one of the baron de guermantess stud grooms. does your mother know youre out? added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms. franoise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. she smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: always the same, that victor! and she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin  if remotely  to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the republic was about to enforce against the clergy. franoise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant. the duchess must be connected with all that lot, said franoise, bringing the conversation back to the guermantes of the rue de la chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. i cant recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the duke. its the same kindred, anyway. ay, theyre a great family, the guermantes! she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as pascal founds the truth of religion on reason and on the authority of the scriptures. for since there was but the single word great to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. i wonder now if it wouldnt be them that have their castle at guermantes, not a score of miles from combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at algiers, too. my mother and i long asked ourselves who this cousin at algiers could be until finally we discovered that franoise meant by the name algiers the town of angers. what is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. franoise, who knew the name algiers from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the new year, had never heard of angers. her language, like the french language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. i meant to talk to their butler about it. what is it again you call him? she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: oh, of course, its antoine you call him! as though antoine had been a title. hes the one who could tell me, but hes quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, youd say theyd cut his tongue out, or that hed forgotten to learn to speak. he makes no response when you talk to him, went on franoise, who used make response in the same sense as mme. de svign. but, she added, quite untruthfully, so long as i know whats boiling in my pot, i dont bother my head about whats in other peoples. whatever he is, hes not a catholic. besides, hes not a courageous man. (this criticism might have led one to suppose that franoise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. but it was not so. courageous meant simply a hard worker.) they do say, too, that hes thievish as a magpie, but it doesnt do to believe all one hears. the servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the duchess against them. but its safe to say that hes a real twister, that antoine, and his antoinesse is no better, concluded franoise, who, in furnishing the name antoine with a feminine ending that would designate the butlers wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. if so, she was not far wrong. there is still a street near notre-dame called rue chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male canons) by those frenchmen of olden days of whom franoise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. she proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: but one thing sure and certain is that its the duchess that has guermantes castle. and its she that is the lady mayoress down in those parts. thats always something. i can well believe that it is something, came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony. you think so, do you, my boy, you think its something? why, for folk like them to be mayor and mayoress, its just thank you for nothing. ah, if it was mine, that guermantes castle, you wouldnt see me setting foot in paris, i can tell you. im sure a family whove got something to go on with, like monsieur and madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to combray the moment theyre free to start, and no one hindering them. why do they put off retiring? theyve got everything they want. why wait till theyre dead? ah, if i had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time id have of it at home in my brothers poor old house at combray. down there you do feel youre alive; you havent all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more. that must indeed be fine! exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to combray as the gondola is to venice. a more recent arrival in the household than my fathers valet, he used to talk to franoise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. and franoise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the housekeeper, that peculiar tenderness which princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a highness. at any rate one knows what ones about, there, and what time of year it is. it isnt like here where you wont find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy easter any more than you would at christmas, and i cant hear so much as the tiniest anglus ring when i lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. down there, you can hear every hour; theres only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: my brother will be coming in from the field now, and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. but here its daytime and its nighttime, and you go to bed, and you cant say any more than the dumb beasts what youve been about all day. i gather msglise is a fine place, too, madame, broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention msglise. oh! msglise, is it? said franoise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names  msglise, combray, tansonville. they were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself. yes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is msglise; she went on with a tinkling laugh, but how did you ever come to hear tell of msglise? how did i hear of msglise? but its a well-known place; people have told me about it  yes, over and over again, he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed. i can tell you, its better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day. she spoke to them even of eulalie as a good person. for since eulalies death franoise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to put on airs. it no longer pained her that eulalie had so skilfully managed, sunday after sunday, to secure her trifle from my aunt. as for the latter, franoise never left off singing her praises. but it was at combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of madame? asked the young footman. yes, with mme. octave  oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish. (franoise used the word pity in the sense given it by labruyre.) it was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years. (this reflection was not really a slur upon us, for franoise belonged to an epoch when the words damages was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) ah, i can tell you, people didnt go empty away from that house. as his reverence the cur has told us, manys the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the throne of god, it was she. poor madame, i can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: you know, franoise, i can eat nothing myself, but i want it all to be just as nice for the others as if i could. they werent for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. if youd only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasnt that much of her. she would never listen to a word i said, she would never send for the doctor. ah, it wasnt in that house that youd have to gobble down your dinner. she liked her servants to be fed properly. here, its been just the same again to-day; we havent had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes. what annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. she was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her dancing. i can tell you frankly, the young footman assured her, that i never saw the like. he said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. yes, yes, the butler muttered, but that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in canada, and the minister told monsieur the other evening that hes clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it. there was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. he did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my fathers immediately turning him out of the house. but the philosophy of combray made it impossible for franoise to expect that the strikes in canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. so long as the world goes round, look, therell be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding. in disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as franoise in reckoning the duration of the latters dinner) had been saying: what on earth can they be doing? theyve been at least two hours at their dinner. and she rang timidly three or four times. franoise, her footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. and so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, franoise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: theyve got the jumps to-day, surely, going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence. despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, franoise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that i did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and i realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. but just as elstir, when the bay of balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earths surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by whistler in his harmonies in blue and silver, so the name guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of franoises hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the duchess: she is the first lady in the faubourg saint-germain; hers is the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain. no doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn i had dreamed. and yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation. and it became all the more essential that i should be able to explore in the drawing-room of mme. de guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since i did not find it in her person when i saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. once before, indeed, in the church at combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. and yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had i lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. but now, frequently, i saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if i did not succeed in integrating in her the name guermantes, i cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that i demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. thus mme. de guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; i had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, i would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. but as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so i assured myself that, had i been given the right of entry into mme. de guermantess house, were i one of her friends, were i to penetrate into her life, i should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my fathers friend had said that the guermantes set was something quite by itself in the faubourg saint-germain. the life which i supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, i felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that i could not have imagined the presence, at the duchesss parties, of people in whose company i myself had already been, of people who really existed. for not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that i knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the faubourg saint-germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that i had already lived. which was impossible. it was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the presence of our lords body in the host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, i could hear its carpets being beaten. but the line of demarcation that separated me from the faubourg saint-germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. i felt clearly that it was already part of the faubourg, when i saw the guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. for the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which i could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the faubourg saint-germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the faubourg saint-germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of mme. de guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the faubourg saint-germain. no doubt elsewhere than in the faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. but here, in the leading house in the faubourg saint-german, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. they were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that mme. de guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the apostles in the sainte-chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the holy table. as for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings mme. de guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could i not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs  endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa  without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the faubourg saint-germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of figuig without thereby being necessarily in africa. only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the faubourg saint-germain, never probably should i be permitted to set my feet among them. and i must content myself with a shiver of excitement as i sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore. but if the htel de guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. more than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of jupiens shop, whereupon jupien, to the dukes indignation, demanded compensation. if it were only in consideration of all the good that madame la duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish, said m. de guermantes, it is an outrage on this fellows part to claim a penny from us. but jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what good the duchess had ever done. and yet she did do good, but  since one cannot do good to everybody at once  the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. from other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the duke  and this over a considerable area  to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. after seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the champs-elyses. m. de guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the baron and baronne de norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. they were the nephew and niece of the old ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. they had not been long in the place; jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting m. de guermantes, called him m. norpois, not being certain of his name. monsieur norpois, indeed! oh, that really is good! just wait a little! this individual will be calling you comrade norpois next! exclaimed m. de guermantes, turning to the baron. he was at last able to vent his spleen against jupien who addressed him as monsieur, instead of monsieur le duc. one day when m. de guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. after that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesans or courtiers shamelessness, that he, the duc de guermantes, made no bargain about my fathers right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. he had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? and besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the duchess in the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that i was to go and see her, and, remembering that i had been intending to go in for literature, had added that i should meet several authors there. but my father felt that i was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good. as one of mme. de guermantess footmen was in the habit of talking to franoise, i picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which i saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable? to-night theres a big party with a chinese shadow show at the princesse de parmes, said the footman, but we shant be going, because at five oclock madame is taking the train to chantilly, to spend a few days with the due daumale; but itll be the ladys maid and valet that are going with her. im to stay here. she wont be at all pleased, the princesse de parme wont, thats four times already shes written to madame la duchesse. then you wont be going down to guermantes castle this year? its the first time we shant be going there: its because of the dukes rheumatics, the doctor says hes not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but weve been there every year till now, right on to january. if the hot pipes arent ready, perhaps madame will go for a few days to cannes, to the duchesse de guise, but nothings settled yet. and to the theatre, do you go, sometimes? we go now and then to the opra, usually on the evenings when the princesse de parme has her box, thats once a week; it seems its a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes madames friends take, one one night, another another, often with the princesse de guermantes, the dukes cousins lady. shes sister to the duke of bavaria. and so youve got to run upstairs again now, have you? went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat franoise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. you enjoy good health, maam. oh, if it wasnt for these cursed legs of mine! on the plain i can still get along (on the plain meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where franoise had no objection to walking, in other words on a plane surface) but its these stairs that do me in, devil take them. good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening. she was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of france, be very strongly implanted still in her people. for franoise, to whom you might speak of the genius of napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the duc de guermantes was generally called prince dolron, would at once exclaim: thats fine, that is! and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church. franoise learned also from the prince dagrigentes valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the marquis de saint-loup to mlle. dambresac, and that it was practically settled. that villa, that opera-box, into which mme. de guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. the names of guise, of parme, of guermantes-baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. if they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of mme. de guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. each of them gave to the life of the duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. the duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the mediterranean at carnival time, but, in the villa of mme. de guise, where the queen of parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the princesse de parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the princesse de guermantes. as we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that persons life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from franoise that mme. de guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the princesse de parme, i saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the faubourg saint-germain that i saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre. my father had a friend at the ministry, one a. j. moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, a.j. well, somehow or other, this a. j. found himself entitled to a stall at the opra-comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as berma, whom i had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of phdre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me. to tell the truth, i attached no importance to this possibility of hearing berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. and it was not without a sense of melancholy that i realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time i had put before health, comfort, everything. it was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. but my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that i had brought to bear the inner faith i had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of berma, the counterpart that i possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. this art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. no deep-lying soul inhabited it any more. that evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, i was climbing the grand staircase of the opera, i saw in front of me a man whom i took at first for m. de charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff i saw that i had been mistaken, but i had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. for, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or big business a strongly marked difference. where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. it is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy bankers son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the austrian emperor, the prince of saxony, who happened to be in paris at the time. i knew him to be a great friend of the guermantes. as i reached the attendant i heard the prince of saxony (or his double) say with a smile: i dont know the number; it was my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box. he may well have been the prince of saxony; it was perhaps of the duchesse de guermantes (whom, in that event, i should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousins box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box, so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word box and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. i had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but i kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the prince of saxony and was on his way to join the duchesse de guermantes. and, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the greek warrior in the hour of battle. i took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from phdre which i could not quite remember. in the form in which i repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as i made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. it would not have surprised me to learn that i must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. but suddenly i remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the waters brink. and, after all, this excrescence with which i had been struggling consisted of but a single foot. a certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. and it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the princesse de parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew. next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. they went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. which was the exact opposite of what did happen. a budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive  avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the hebrews in the red sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. on the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little cafs, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds. at first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck  like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see  the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of henri iv on a dark background, the bent profile of the due daumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming monseigneur must allow me to take his coat, to which the prince replied, oh, come, come! really, madame dambresac. she took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured. but in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. for the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. they leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. but of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the princesse de guermantes. like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. at once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyons nest. over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the south seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the princesss eyes. the beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. but the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness. thats the princesse de guermantes, said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word princesse with a string of ps, to shew that a title like that was absurd. she hasnt been sparing with her pearls. im sure, if i had as many as that, i wouldnt make such a display of them; it doesnt look at all well, not to my mind. and yet, when they caught sight of the princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. indeed, with the duchesse de luxembourg, with mme. de morienval, with mme. de saint-euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. these features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. but like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of mme. de guermantes-bavire, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the princess in her palaces in munich and in paris. our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that i had heard any mention of the princesse de guermantes-bavire, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. i was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that i saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. certainly i was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. i understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. for all i knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for i saw her smile): do have one, wont you? what mattered that to me? i should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of mrime or meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: thanks; i should like a cherry. and i should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from le mari de la dbutante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, i suppose, meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive. that fat fellow is the marquis de gananay, came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind. the marquis de palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. no one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. but now, because the act ofphdre in which berma was playing was due to start, the princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, i saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. and in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the princess, ceasing to be a nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of zare, or perhaps of orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row i saw that the soft halcyons nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was  downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise. but now my gaze was diverted from the princesse de guermantess box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. at length the curtain went up. i could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which i would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, i kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to africa, to the west indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when i trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artists part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when i should not have believed that i was watching it in the most perfect conditions had i not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which i then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. phdre, the declaration scene, berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, i must go to meet them, i should penetrate what i could of them, and if i opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent i should still absorb but a very little of them. but how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that i myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities, phdre and the way in which berma spoke her part. steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), i was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. and a time had come when, ill as i was, even if i had believed that i should die of it, i should still have been compelled to go and hear berma. but now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which i took cognisance because i was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people i knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of phdre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of french poetry, of which they were merely a part. i felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. the day on which i rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which i ought to have started for venice, or that on which i did go to hear berma, or start for balbec, that i felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then i might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which i would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. i discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which i had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. in the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. and even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, i might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which i would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while i sat reading all afternoon in the garden at combray, lay the thought of perfection. i no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which i had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of aricie, ismne and hippolyte. it was not that the players  they were the same, by the way  did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. their intonations bade the voice: be gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo; or else, now wax furious, and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. but it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter. similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: be majestic. but each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. at this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed: not a hand! did you ever see such a get-up? shes too old; she cant play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago. amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. this fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. but the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against berma. the latter had just corne on to the stage. and then  oh, the miracle  like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life  the talent of berma, which had evaded me when i sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, i deducted, so to speak, from what i heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as phdre, which i had myself studied beforehand so that i might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of mme. berma. but this talent which i sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. so with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. the intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of aricie, ismne or hippolyte i had been able to distinguish, but phdre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. bermas voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of aricie or ismne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. bermas arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. so bermas interpretation was, around racines work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius. my own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. only, i no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and i understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. it had just occurred to me that if i had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of berma, it was because, as earlier still when i used to meet gilberte in the champs-elyses, i had come to her with too strong a desire. between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. the impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. we have brought to it the ideas of beauty, breadth of style, pathos and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a correct face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. it hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. it asks itself: is that good? is what i am feeling just now admiration? is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength? and what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for breadth of interpretation. and for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression. this was precisely what bermas acting shewed me. this was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. now i could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of mars, venus, saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. we feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. it was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that i had had to cross when, that afternoon on which i went first to bear berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, i had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of nobility of interpretation, of originality, and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that i found in saying to myself: at last i am listening to berma. and the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. wherefore we fail to recognise them. i had found no pleasure in listening to berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing gilberte). i had said to myself: well, i do not admire this. but then i was thinking only of mastering the secret of bermas acting, i was preoccupied with that alone, i was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. i understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration. this genius of which bermas rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of racine and nothing more? i thought so at first. i was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from phdre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. the piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time i had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. but i had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. besides, at every fresh passage which, i felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past i added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the authors other works. and this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of phdre. not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. but berma was as sublime in one as in the other. i realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom i had met at balbec, elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. and as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. no doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and bermas diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? but berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of racine berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter. i had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate bermas attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. i realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. i did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear berma again. i was satisfied with her; it was when i admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were gilberte or berma, that i demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterdays impression had refused to afford me. without seeking to analyse the joy which i had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, i said to myself, as in the old days i might have said to one of my schoolfellows: certainly, i put berma first! not without a confused feeling that bermas genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a first place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me. just as the curtain was rising on this second play i looked up at mme. de guermantess box. the princess was in the act  by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void  of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the duchesse de guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the jockey club  who at that moment, and among them all m. de palancy in particular, were the men whom i should most have liked to be  the familiar good evening of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. i felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could i have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. the duc de guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. one would have said that the duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her exaggerations (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically french and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the duchess thought of her as dressed up, and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the princesss head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively british. but different as their two costumes were, after the princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation. possibly a smile would curve the lips of mme. de guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little tailor-made in her cousins way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. by those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. as, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an arrangement supposed to suggest that of the princesse de guermantes simply made the baronne de morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the duchesse de guermantes only made mme. de cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of ravens feathers stuck vertically in her hair. perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire. the explanation of mme. de cambremers presence on this occasion was that the princesse de parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like mme. de cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. mme. de cambremer never took her eyes off the duchesse and princesse de guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. she had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. but having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which  for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge  she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. this evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young marquis de beausergent, mme. dargencourts brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. he was seated behind mme. de cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. he knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. he often accepted these invitations to go with mme. de cambremer to the play. in the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. if at such moments there swept by him the princesse de guermantes, lightfoot and fair as diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by mme. de cambremers), m. de beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient. had not mme. de cambremer known already that the box belonged to the princess, she could still have told that the duchesse de guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. but simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. mme. de cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. she knew that the duchess was staying on very late at guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. but she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, mme. de guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at combray and so be in paris the same evening. perhaps she has come up from guermantes on purpose to hear berma, thought mme. de cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. and she remembered having heard swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with m. de charlus: the duchess is one of the noblest souls in paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society. for myself, who derived from the names guermantes, bavaria and cond what i imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (i could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), i would rather have had their opinion of phdre than that of the greatest critic in the world. for in his i should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. but what the duchesse and princesse de guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, i imagined with the aid of their names, i endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what i demanded that their opinion of phdre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that i had spent in wandering along the guermantes way. mme. de cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. for my own part, i never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of guermantes and cond, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. the toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which i had seen the princesse de guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousins glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which i would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from juno, and i did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of minerva. and when i turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though i had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the assembly of the gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of heaven. i gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that i myself was unknown to these immortals; the duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for i had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, i suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, i saw a ray illumine them; the duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile. and now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, i went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as i drew level with her, but as though i had not in the least expected to see her. indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, i waited opposite the house. and every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom i was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. for never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as i was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk  and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking  a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. but after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, i betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the duchesss usual route. often before that evening at the theatre i had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine i would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, i caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, i stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; i tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom i followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which i promised myself that i would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. no matter, i was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that i had learned that the streets of paris, like the roads round balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom i had so often sought to evoke from the woods of msglise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging. on coming home from the opra-comique i had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past i had been hoping to meet again the form of mme. de guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousins box. i would follow the course which franoise had told me that the duchess generally took, and i would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom i had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. but in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of mme. de guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. and without exactly knowing what i was doing, i tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which i had long held and which albertines coldness, gisles premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that i brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards i was trying to adapt my memory of the duchess. compared with those ideas my memory of mme. de guermantes at the opra-comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover i had been quite familiar with the ideas long before i came to know mme. de guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, i possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association  exclusive of every other feminine form  with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which i remembered it most clearly that i ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but i did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with mme. de guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really mme. de guermantes; during the few hours in which i was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently i could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams i probably altered it completely, for whenever i saw mme. de guermantes i realised the difference  never twice, as it happened, the same  between what i had imagined and what i saw. and now every morning, certainly at the moment when mme. de guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street i saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair  all the things for which i was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which i had come out to seek, i raised them to look at the duchess at the moment in which we converged, what i saw then were red patches (as to which i knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the phdre evening, acknowledged my salute, which i addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. and yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of mme. de guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that i finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. i had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet i had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what i had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. now i should not even have been able to say what mme. de guermantes was like, by what i recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat. why did i one morning, when i saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that i was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of mme. de guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some egyptian deity? once it was not merely a woman with a birds beak that i saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of mme. de guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. from the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue. one day i had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of mme. de guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycooks shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before i had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, i realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, i was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, i realised suddenly that the movement of her head which i saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom i had supposed that i did not know, was mme. de guermantes, by whom i had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. and sometimes i came upon her as i entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye i loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. for the entire staff of the guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his day out stopped by the duchess to whom this cerberus was betraying him. in view of the whole series of different faces which mme. guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, i felt that it was still mme. de guermantes. what i loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life i would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. she might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions losing their importance for me. i should not myself have felt that mme. de guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had i not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which franoise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. the moment i asked her for my outdoor things i felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. i made no attempt to win her confidence, for i knew that i should not succeed. she had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which i have never been able to fathom. perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the european colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. so, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly mme. de guermantess servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to franoise. my parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than franoise to my person, still i should have been no better off. franoise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. in her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had a place of their own but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. as the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in paris was decorated with the words of franoise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. and she could in paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mothers deathbed, which she still vividly saw. but in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to paris and had entered our service she had acquired  as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired  the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were employers after all. this alteration in franoise character was perhaps inevitable. certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the king at versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a pharaoh or a doge  and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. the life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. but it was actually in details more intimate still that i should have been obliged, if i had dismissed franoise, to keep the same servant. for various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. as, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. of these gaps i knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. but my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. it was from the defects which they invariably acquired that i learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. we had always laughed, my mother and i, at mme. sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like the lower orders or the servant class. but i am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing franoise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular. to return to franoise, i never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her i tried to pretend that on the contrary i had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. for she knew the truth. she refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. she refrained from uttering it, or so at least i long believed, for at that time i still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that i could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than franoise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (if, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) but she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which i was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than franoise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering ones head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. i might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that i said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while i made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by franoise); i ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so i should first have had to be conscious that i myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. when franoise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and i could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. but jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which i learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that i was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that i had tried to insult her in every possible way. these words of jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with franoise so different from that on which i used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, franoise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that i realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. however that might be, this sudden outlet which jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. so far it was only franoise that was revealed, and of her i barely thought. was it the same with all ones social relations? and in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? that was the futures secret. for the present only franoise was concerned. did she sincerely believe what she had said to jupien? had she said it to embroil jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint jupiens girl as her successor? at any rate i realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether franoise loved or lothed me. and thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as i had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information  a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love. i was genuinely in love with mme. de guermantes. the greatest happiness that i could have asked of god would have been that he should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. i imagined her doing so. and indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, i preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me  me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. and when i had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which i should welcome the duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; i had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, i could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner  and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen. i felt that i was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if i had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, mme. de guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. and indeed i could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. i should have had to go away for some time; and for that i had not the heart. i did think of it more than once. i would then tell franoise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. and as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, franoise, borrowing the expression from her daughters vocabulary, used to remark that i was dippy. she did not approve of this; she said that i was always balancing, for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of saint-simon. it is true that she liked it still less when i spoke to her as master to servant. she knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as where there isnt a will. i should never have had the heart to leave paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to mme. de guermantes. this was by no means an impossibility. should i not indeed find myself nearer to her than i was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which i should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if i were to go miles away from mme. de guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what i wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because i should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, i should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. what she did during the mysterious daily life of the guermantes that she was  this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street? the friendship, the admiration that saint-loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. all at once i attached a value to them, i would have liked him to disclose them to mme. de guermantes, i was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. for when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. we are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown. saint-loup had not for a long time been able to come to paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. he had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if i came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving balbec, had caused me so much joy when i had read it on the envelope of the first letter i received from my friend. it was (not so far from balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which  as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see  indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. it was not too far away from paris for me to be able, if i took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. as soon as i realised this, troubled by a painful longing, i had too little will power to decide not to return to paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as i walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. i thought that saint-loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which i should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. one of the guard went to find him, and i waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the november wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six oclock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored. saint-loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; i had not given my name, i was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. oh! what a bore! he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. i have just had a weeks leave, and i shant be off duty again for another week. and, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which i did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship. i say! where are you going to sleep? really, i cant recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the exhibition ground, where theres a show just starting; youll find it beastly crowded. no, youd better go to the htel de flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. it makes quite an old-world residence. saint-loup employed in every connexion the word makes for has the air of, because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. and just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the turns of speech that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of saint-loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. besides, he concluded, the hotel i mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. you will have no neighbours. i quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. no, it is for its appeal to the eye that i recommend it. the rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that. but to me, less of an artist than saint-loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which i used to feel long ago at combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which i felt on the evening of my arrival at balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. saint-loup read all this in my fixed gaze. a lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; youre quite pale; and here am i like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you wont have the heart to look at, even. i know the room theyll put you in; personally i find it most enlivening, but i can quite understand that it wont have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. you mustnt think i dont understand; i dont feel the same myself, but i can put myself in your place. at that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to saint-loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. but his horse at once reared. saint-loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side. yes, he resumed; i assure you that i fully understand; i feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. i am wretched, he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, when i think that if i could have stayed with you to-night, i might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. i can lend you any number of books, but you wont want to read if youre feeling like that. and i shant be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; ive been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me. and he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease. run along and light the fire in my quarters, he called to a trooper who passed us. hurry up; get a move on! after which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship. no! to see you here, in these barracks where i have spent so much time thinking about you, i can scarcely believe my eyes. i must be dreaming. and how are you? better, i hope. you must tell me all about yourself presently. well go up to my room; we mustnt hang about too long on the square, theres the devil of a draught; i dont feel it now myself, but you arent accustomed to it, im afraid of your catching cold. and what about your work; have you started yet? no? you are a quaint fellow! if i had your talent im sure i should be writing morning, noon and night. it amuses you more to do nothing? what a pity it is that its the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, wont. there, and ive clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. her proudhons are in safe keeping. i never part from them. an officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. saint-loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. but he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of saint-loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap. i must just say a word to the captain, whispered saint-loup. be a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. its the second on the right, on the third floor; ill be with you in a minute. and setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the first empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at doncires, and which stood in a square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this napoleonid, place de la rpublique. i started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. i was shewn saint-loups room. i stood for a moment outside its closed door, for i could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; i felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. but it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. it could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. i entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. and even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment i saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if i had been on the other side of a wall i should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. i sat down in the room and waited. liberty hangings and old german stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. it was here, in this banning room, that i could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind saint-loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which i could make out my own and that of the duchesse de guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. i heard the tick of saint-loups watch, which could not be far away. this tick changed its place every moment for i could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. suddenly i caught sight of the watch on the table. then i heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. that is to say, i thought i heard it at this place; i did not hear it there; i saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in saint-loups fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the grandplace of doncires. let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. the dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. the withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. we play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. and in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the other person with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that persons hands. to return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a sovereign were expected to pass. and indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like l boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. the empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. in the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. and when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world. only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. the man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as our lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard  sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. but if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. at other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. and for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an eden, in which sound has not yet been created. the highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of paradise. as sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. they move, halt, become alight of their own accord. of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. in the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. and, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window  be it barracks, church, or town hall  is only so much scenery. if one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence. the silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where i sat waiting was now broken. the door opened and saint-loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in. ah, my dear robert, you make yourself very comfortable here, i said to him; how jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here. and to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness i could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam;  a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness. so youd rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself? saint-loup asked me, smiling. oh, robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it, i pleaded; you know its not possible, and you know how wretched i shall be over there. good! you flatter me! he replied. it occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. and that is precisely what i stopped to ask the captain. and he has given you leave? i cried. he hadnt the slightest objection. oh! i adore him! no; that would be going too far. but now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner, he went on, while i turned away so as to hide my tears. we were several times interrupted by one or other of saint-loups friends coming in. he drove them all out again. get out of here. buzz off! i begged him to let them stay. no, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. besides, i dont want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments ive been looking forward to. but you mustnt think, when i tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. far from it. we have a major here who is a splendid chap. hes given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldnt fail to appreciate. thats not the officer whos given me leave to stay here to-night? no; thank god! the man you adore for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. he is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. there you have his mentality. apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major i was telling you about. no one will speak to him because hes a freemason and doesnt go to confession. the prince de borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. which is pretty fair cheek, when alls said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadnt been for the napoleonic wars. not that he hasnt a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where hes neither flesh nor fowl. he hardly ever shews his face at the jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called prince, added robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the empire. i was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since saint-loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. for this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that i had already had, with mme. de guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom i had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, i could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. later on, when i looked at robert, i noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which i found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. the features of the duchesse de guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of combray, the nose like a falcons beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out  in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin  of roberts face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunts. i saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird. robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. this was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; i ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude  the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. and next morning, when i awoke, i rose and went to cast from saint-loups window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which i had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. and yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, i could see the ground, when i opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. but i knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. in the meantime, i could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. through the transparent curtain of frost i could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. but when i had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when i did not see it, than the hotel at balbec, than our house in paris, of which i thought as of absent  or dead  friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although i was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that i formed at doncires, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by saint-loups batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill  the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of combray. it did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. the hill might expose its grizzled rump to the suns rays, which, an hour later, when i went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as i went, on the pavements from which i could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy. but after that first night i had to sleep at the hotel. and i knew beforehand that i was doomed to find sorrow there. it was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which i usually occupied i was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. but i could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where i preceded him, where i arrived by myself, where i must bring into contact with its environment that self which i rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since combray, since my first arrival at balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk. as it happened, i was mistaken. i had no time to be sad, for i was not left alone for an instant. the fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company  neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that i came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. in short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. one tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. and one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps. if i wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. but the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs i had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the alps to find that the act  as a rule not noticed  of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. i received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when i set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever i knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which i had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. i looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which i felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass  of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the directory  offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if i had been sitting on the hearthrug. the walls held the room in  close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. and the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if i left them open when i withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. this closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom i was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above. before going to bed i decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. i walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if i could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. when i came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply now you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours, while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if i did not sleep that night i could easily come in barefoot, and the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour i chose to come in, i need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. and behind a hanging curtain i surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. i went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. and as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which i was in the habit of drawing. if i had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which i was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which i was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when i turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. it is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. it needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. we awake, look at our watch, see four oclock; it is only four oclock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an emperors orb of gold. in the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the msglise way, i was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. but on several occasions  and i mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea  the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and i heard nothing. on the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. and the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when saint-loup asked me whether i had heard the band, i was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which i heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. perhaps i had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. for often, when i was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, i had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour i imagined that i was awake, while still drowsing, and i enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which i had the illusion of looking on. what one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in ones dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. the same story branches off and has a different ending. when all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. after having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief absence to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less good night. but already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which auto-suggestions prepare  like witches  the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease. not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. at the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: it is seven oclock, she will find us awake and ready. on the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young siegfried. beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in ciceronian dialogues. next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes. sometimes i had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep. that kind of sleep is called sleeping like lead, and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. one is no longer a person. how then, seeking for ones mind, ones personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover ones own self rather than any other? why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterdays that is incarnate in one? one fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays ones hand? what is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption  whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? there has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. no doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? the resurrection at our awakening  after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep  must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. and perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory. when i had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky  but discouraged by the chill  of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, i raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change i was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. i rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which i had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. the walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that i should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. but they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which i saw quite differently from in paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. on certain days, i was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which i had left half-finished in paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, i had managed to become involved. one or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and i was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. then from the hotel i sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to saint-loup: i told him that, should it be materially possible  i knew that it was extremely difficult for him  i should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. an hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door i felt myself liberated from my obsessions. i knew that, if they were stronger than i, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. he had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which i at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions. i hope you werent angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed. not at all; i just supposed you wanted to see me, and i thought it very nice of you. i was delighted that you should have sent for me. but what is the trouble? things not going well? what can i do to help? he listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, i had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; i was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. all my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which saint-loup undertook to dispatch. life seemed to me so different, so delightful; i was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that i longed for action. what are you doing now? i asked him. i must leave you, im afraid; were going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and i have to be on parade. then its been a great bother to you, coming here? no, no bother at all, the captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you i must go at once; but you understand, i dont like to seem to be abusing the privilege. but if i got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where youll be training, it would interest me immensely, and i could perhaps talk to you during the breaks. i shouldnt advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, i assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the dminralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustnt go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as theyve passed i think youll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner. but soon i was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when i began to take an interest in the military theories which saint-loups friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the cafs in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. to reach the training ground i used to have to take tremendously long walks. in the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. next morning i realised that i had no more heard the band than, at balbec, after the evenings on which saint-loup had taken me to dinner at rivebelle, i used to hear the concert on the beach. and at the moment when i wished to rise i had a delicious feeling of incapacity; i felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. i felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because i had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the guermantes walk. poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. but these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. the fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. this is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good nights rest. good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. there is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. what once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. but we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations. sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; i had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. how blessed then was my return to the hotel! as i got into bed i seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the romances beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. my sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. charming; beneficent perhaps also. i reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. these thoughts carried me far. on days when, although there was no parade, saint-loup had to stay in barracks, i used often to go and visit him there. it was a long way; i had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which i had an immense view. a strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. while i waited for robert  he being engaged on some duty or other  outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on i came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, i could hear him discussed by the others, and i soon learned what a popular favourite he was. among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of saint-loups character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on saturday evenings, when they went on pass to paris, they had seen supping in the caf de la paix with the duc duzs and the prince dorlans. and on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress  the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade  they had introduced the idea of a tone which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic captain to whom i had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common. one of them said that the captain had bought a new horse. he can buy as many horses as he likes. i passed saint-loup on sunday morning in the alle des acacias; now hes got some style on a horse! replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. at any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in saint-loup. it gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table serjeant saint-loup. and what a tale there was to tell in barracks on monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in roberts squadron, and to whom he had said how dye do most civilly, while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, saint-loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speakers direction. yes, my brother saw him at the paix, said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; my brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didnt fit him. what was the waistcoat like? he wasnt wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning! to the old soldiers (sons of the soil who had never heard of the jockey club and simply put saint-loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of saint-loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. they recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the stripes in the regiment, manners like no ones else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. the morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon lay-down in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which saint-loup had appeared on parade. it was the height of my pack. come off it, old chap, you dont expect us to believe that; it couldnt have been the height of your pack, interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a learned beggar, and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him. oh, so it wasnt the height of my pack, wasnt it? you measured it, i suppose! i tell you this much, the c. o. glared at it as if hed have liked to put him in clink. but you neednt think the great saint-loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. well see what the capstan has to say when he hears. oh, very likely hell say nothing, but you may be sure he wont be pleased. but theres nothing so wonderful about that cap. i hear hes got thirty of em and more at home, at his house in town. where did you hear that, old man? from our blasted corporal-dog? asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation. where did i hear it? from his batman; what dyou think? ah! now youre talking. thats a chap who knows when hes well off! i should say so! hes got more in his pocket than i have, certain sure! and besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. he wasnt getting his grub properly, he says. along comes de saint-loup, and gives cooky hell: i want him to be properly fed, dyou hear, he says, and i dont care what it costs. the old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success. on leaving the barracks i would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before i went, as i did every evening, to dine with saint-loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, i made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. in the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. so strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step i took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. i seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of mercury. one of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. next door to the hotel, the old national courts and the louis xvi orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the army corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which i went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. i kept, when i was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that i had felt outside. it gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of bergottes novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which i feel that i should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. i thought with joy of the barracks that i had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, i felt that i was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when i kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings i esteemed as a priceless privilege, which i hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever i chose, always certain of a welcome. at seven oclock i dressed myself and went out again to dine with saint-loup at the hotel where he took his meals. i liked to go there on foot. it was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. as i walked, i ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of mme. de guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that i had come to visit roberts garrison. but a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. there are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. then we pay attention to other things. and the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. the life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which i might not penetrate. here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magicians wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. in a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by rembrandt. sometimes i lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. i proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to msglise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, i felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which i then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and i attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. this gothic alley meant for me something so real that if i had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. i thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget mme. de guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. in the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood i could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. i waited to see them, i stood peering in the direction from which i had heard the sound. but i was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. finally the revellers did appear; not, as i had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, i had been as far wrong over direction as over distance. the wind grew stronger. it was thick and bristling with coming snow. i returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants. and sure enough at the hotel where i was to meet saint-loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, i found, as i hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the everlasting fire, an influx (worthy of some numbering of the people before bethlehem such as the old flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. and similarly, in the big dining-room which i crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where  for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when i arrived  they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. one of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the flemish manner), i went straight  at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues  towards this servitor, in whom i felt that i recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. i should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. a young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in primitive paintings, with pointed ends. fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, i explored my way to the smaller room in which saint-loups table was laid. i found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. on the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, i drew saint-loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him: robert, this is hardly the time or the place for what i am going to say, but i shant be a second. i keep on forgetting to ask you when im in the barracks; isnt that mme. de guermantess photograph that you have on your table? why, yes; my good aunt. of course she is; what a fool i am; you told me before that she was; id forgotten all about her being your aunt. i say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, theyre looking at us; another time will do; it isnt at all important. thats all right; go on as long as you like. they can wait. no, no; i do want to be polite to them; theyre so nice; besides, it doesnt really matter in the least, i assure you. do you know that worthy oriane, then? this worthy oriane, as he might have said, that good oriane, did not imply that saint-loup regarded mme. de guermantes as especially good. in this instance the words good, excellent, worthy are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative that, indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. the word good does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon do you see much of her? or i havent set eyes on her for months, or i shall be seeing her on tuesday, or she must be getting on, now, you know. i cant tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because were living in her house now, in paris, and ive been hearing the most astounding things (i should have been hard put to it to say what) about her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, dont you know, from a  how shall i put it  from a balzacian point of view; but youre so clever you can see what i mean; i dont need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners? they will think absolutely nothing; i have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are. you are too kind. but listen, what i want to say is this: i suppose mme. de guermantes hasnt any idea that i know you, has she? i cant say; i havent seen her since the summer, because i havent had any leave since shes been in town. what i was going to say is this: ive been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot. that i do not believe; oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same shes by no means stupid. you know that, as a rule, i dont care about your advertising the good opinion youre kind enough to hold of me; im not conceited. thats why im sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). but mme. de guermantes is different; if you could let her know  if you would even exaggerate a trifle  what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure. why, of course i will, if thats all you want me to do; its not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? i suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if thats all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; im afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and its so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together. it was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which i could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that i had forgotten his connexion with the duchess, and also did not give him time to frame  with regard to my reasons for wishing that mme. de guermantes should know that i was his friend, was clever, and so forth  questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that i should not have been able to answer them. robert, im surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesnt discuss the things that will give ones friends pleasure; one does them. now i, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed i only wish you would ask me to do something for you, i can assure you i shouldnt want any explanations. i may ask you for more than i really want; i have no desire to know mme. de guermantes, but just to test you i ought to have said that i was anxious to dine with mme. de guermantes; i am sure you would never have done it. not only should i have done it, i will do it. when? next time im in paris, three weeks from now, i expect. we shall see; i dare say she wont want to see me, though. i cant tell you how grateful i am. not at all; its nothing. dont say that; its everything in the world, because now i can see what sort of friend you are; whether what i ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether i am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. a stupid friend would have started a discussion. which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps i wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also i was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. then i went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of mme. de guermantess very features which nature had made in producing her nephew robert: but, i say, we mustnt keep them waiting any longer, and ive mentioned only one of the two things i wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but im afraid you will never consent. would it bore you if we were to call each other tu? bore me? my dear fellow! joy! tears of joy! undreamed-of happiness! thank you  tu i mean; you begin first  ever so much. it is such a pleasure to me that you neednt do anything about mme. de guermantes if youd rather not, this is quite enough for me. i can do both. i say, robert! listen to me a minute, i said to him later while we were at dinner. oh, its really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, i cant think why  you remember the lady i was speaking to you about just now. yes. youre quite sure you know who i mean? why, what do you take me for, a village idiot? you wouldnt care to give me her photograph, i suppose? had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. but when the time came to speak i felt shy, i decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion i put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural. no; i should have to ask her permission first, was his answer. he blushed as he spoke. i could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this i hated him. at the same time i was touched to see how differently saint-loup behaved towards me now that i was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. his increased affability would have left me cold had i thought that it was deliberately assumed; but i could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. in our private conversations i might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. the mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughters responses and to the attitude of the public. if i had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a whats that? to make me repeat what i had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. so that i caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror. it occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about mme. blandais, but i stopped at once, remembering that saint-loup knew it already, and that when i had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: you told me that before, at balbec. i was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. youve forgotten it for the moment, i said to him, but youll remember as i go on. no, really; i swear youre mistaken. youve never told me. do go on. and throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. i realised only after i had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. such is the stuff of friendship. on the third evening, one of his friends, to whom i had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and i overheard him telling saint-loup how much he had been enjoying himself. and indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at balbec, that feeling which saint-loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. and yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. i could not help asking robert when he spoke to me about balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry mlle. dambresac. he assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. if at that moment i had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of mlle. dambresac to some one who was not saint-loup and that of saint-loup to some one who was not mlle. dambresac. i should have surprised them greatly had i reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. in order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long. saint-loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of dreyfus. just as a brother of this friend of saint-loup, who had been trained at the schola cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when i told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a mentality, as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of dreyfusards in general and of bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. similarly one of saint-loups cousins had married a young eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as victor hugos or alfred de vignys, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an eastern princess immured in an arabian nights palace. for the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of alfred de vigny or victor hugo. that fellow? oh, hes not like saint-loup, hes a regular devil, my new friend informed me; hes not even straight about it. at first, he used to say: just wait a little, theres a man i know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, general de boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision. but as soon as he heard that boisdeffre had pronounced dreyfus guilty, boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of saussier, and he, a soldier of the republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. but when saussier pronounced esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to dreyfus but to general saussier. it was the militarist spirit that blinded saussier (and i must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; i dont know what to think of him now). his family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas. dont you think, i suggested, turning half towards saint-loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, that the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. one is the man of ones idea. there are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. as there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it. at this point i was interrupted by saint-loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: duroc! duroc all over! i had no idea what this might mean, but i felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. while i was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to saint-loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. and just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: gibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. you can tell us about it afterwards. and to me: please go on. i gave a sigh of relief, for i had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again. and as an idea, i went on, is a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations. when i had finished, thats one in the eye for you, my boys, exclaimed saint-loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if i had been walking upon a tight-rope. what were you going to say, gibergue? i was just saying that your friend reminded me of major duroc. i seemed to hear him speaking. why, ive often thought so myself, replied saint-loup; they have several points in common, but youll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that duroc hasnt got. saint-loup was not satisfied with this comparison. in an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: youre the cleverest man i know, do you hear? he corrected himself, and added: you and elstir.  you dont mind my bracketing him with you, i hope. you understand  punctiliousness. its like this: i say it to you as one might have said to balzac: you are the greatest novelist of the century  you and stendhal. excessive punctiliousness, dont you know, and at heart an immense admiration. no? you dont admit stendhal? he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. oh, good! i see youre on my side; bloch cant stand stendhal. i think its idiotic of him. the chartreuse is after all an immense work, dont you think? i am so glad you agree with me. what is it you like best in thechartreuse, answer me? he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. and the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. mosca? fabrice? i answered timidly that mosca reminded me a little of m. de norpois. whereupon peals of laughter from the young siegfried saint-loup. and while i was going on to explain: but mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic, i heard robert cry: bravo! actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: oh, perfect! admirable! you really are astounding. i took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all roberts friends and to robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, i had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom i saw in the square when i went to visit saint-loup, or, if i was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. i should have liked to know more about the major whom saint-loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me even from an aesthetic point of view. i knew that with robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. unfortunately, from the military point of view robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of dreyfus. he spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. a firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of dreyfus and retained his admiration for picquart. in the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. for, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former chief of the intelligence branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. however this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid saint-loup the compliment of telling him  in the tone in which a catholic lady might tell a jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain israelites  that their colonel was not, with regard to dreyfusism  to a certain kind of dreyfusism, at least  the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be. i am not surprised, was saint-loups comment; for hes a sensible man. but in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. now, he turned to me, major duroc, the lecturer on military history i was telling you about; theres a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so im told. and i should have been surprised to hear that he wasnt, for hes not only a brilliantly clever man, but a radical-socialist and a freemason. partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of saint-loups faith in dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, i asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. it is absolutely true. but what do you mean by that? well, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. so that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind. give me an example or two, if you dont mind. it is not very easy to explain, saint-loup broke in. you read, let us say, that this or that corps has tried    but before we go any further, the serial number of the corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. if it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. next, we must ask ourselves what was this corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemys, which gives to the operation on which this corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. and then, the serial number of the corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. if, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. you can understand that if, in the analysis of the corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. one must study what i may call the whole geographical context, he added with a laugh. and indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. while the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. an exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (which was a classic feint in napoleons wars.) on the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the higher command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. we are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. if, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the higher command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from headquarters. and there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. so that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. but just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. observe that i am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall i call it?) spatial identity of battles. that exists also. a battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. if it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. and so what it has been it will continue to be. a painter doesnt make a studio out of any old room; so you dont make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. there are places set apart for the purpose. but, once again, this is not what i was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. battles like ulm, lodi, leipzig, cannae. i cant say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commanders part) a cannae, an austerlitz, a rosbach, a waterloo. some of our people say quite openly that marshal von schieffer and general falkenhausen have prepared a battle of cannae against france, in the hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through belgium, while bernhardi prefers the oblique order of frederick the great, lenthen rather than cannae. others expound their views less crudely, but i can tell you one thing, my boy, that beauconseil, the squadron commander i introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. the break through in the centre at rivoli, too; thats a thing that will crop up if theres ever another war. its no more obsolete than the iliad. i must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we cant afford to repeat the mistake we made in seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. the only thing that troubles me is that if i see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, i mean mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. it is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory. the enunciation of these theories by saint-loup made me happy. they gave me to hope that perhaps i was not being led astray, in my life at doncires, with regard to these officers whom i used to hear being discussed while i sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while i was at balbec the king and queen of the south sea island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, legrandins brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. what gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that i still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which i had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, saint-loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that i might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after i had left doncires i should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. at the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word: you interest me  i beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously, i said to saint-loup, but tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. i feel that i could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so i must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. you tell me that plans of battles are copied. i do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, i cant tell you how attractive it sounds. but then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? does he really do no more than apply the rules? or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait? i should just say so! you will find napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. for instance, look at austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to lannes. but you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of napoleons movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. there are a dozen examples of that in 1870. but even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. it is his instinct, his divination  like mme. de thbes (you follow me?) which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. thus ive been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. but it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. if i had time now to go through the napoleonic wars from this point of view, i assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal  no, i know youre not well, i apologise!  well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the higher command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. i may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. in reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march. now you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago. not at all. you remember that book of philosophy we read together at balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. very well. it is the same again with the art of strategy. in a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. and here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. for of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. he may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what i call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. but it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what i call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. thus at ulm, mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. my example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. and ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. but it doesnt much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. to go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician poincar is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. as to the rules themselves, which i mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. we cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the field service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major i was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially. saint-loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next field service will shew signs of this evolution, put in my other neighbour. i am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine, said saint-loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. perhaps i may have underestimated the importance of the rules; i dont know. they do change, that must be admitted. but in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. if they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. all this is a little too technical for you, he remarked to me. after all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. in the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. but all that is a thing of the past. with the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed. dont be so touchy, i told saint-loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. i was listening to you quite eagerly. if you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak, his friend went on, i shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. it may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the prussian guard at saint-privat, and the turcos at froeschviller and wissembourg. ah! interchangeable; very neat! excellent! the lad has brains, was saint-loups comment. i was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, i was afforded a glimpse of the general law. still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, i was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to saint-loup, was quite possible and had been done by napoleon more than once. and to understand what military worth meant i asked for comparisons between the various generals whom i knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature. i felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of mme. de guermantes, by the hospitality of saint-loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. they gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by bernard palissy. i am jealous, furious, saint-loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which i had been having with his friend. is it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? well, i suppose hes everything now, and no one else is to have a look in! men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture. when the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to dreyfus for fear of offending saint-loup. the following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. the reason is, i suggested, not wishing to enter into details, that the influence of environment is not so important as people think     i intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which i had made to saint-loup a few days earlier. since, however, i had repeated these words almost textually, i proceeded to excuse myself by adding: as, in fact, i was saying the other day     but i had reckoned without the reverse side of roberts polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. that admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. and so, in the matter of my modest theory, saint-loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though i were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval. why, yes; environment is of no importance. and with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him: the real influence is that of ones intellectual environment! one is the man of ones idea! he stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare: all men with similar ideas are alike, he informed me, with a challenging air. probably he had completely forgotten that i myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well. i did not arrive at saint-loups restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. if a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. there were evenings when, as i passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, i felt so keen a longing for mme. de guermantes that i could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. and however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for ones entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of ones body. only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. at the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. i would look up at the sky. if it were clear, i would say to myself: perhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all i know, when i arrive at the restaurant robert may say to me: good news! i have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here. it was not in the firmament alone that i enshrined the thought of mme. de guermantes, a passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from gilberte in the cornfields of msglise. we do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. what brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that i knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. simply because i thought that i recognised sorrows which i had felt on gilbertes account, or else when in the evenings at combray mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of bergotte, in the agony i now felt, to which mme. de guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, i did not conclude that mme. de guermantes was not the cause of that agony. is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? and yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. as i made my way to the restaurant i said to myself: a fortnight already since i last saw mme. de guermantes. a fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when mme. de guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. for me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which i felt that i could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the duchess again. and i was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. one day i said to myself: perhaps there will be a letter to-night; and on entering the dining-room i found courage to ask saint-loup: you dont happen to have had any news from paris? yes, he replied gloomily; bad news. i breathed a sigh of relief when i realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. but i soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt. i learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. and the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. for she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. to say that saint-loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. when he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. what he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at doncires, or have sailed for the indies. it has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. it increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? it has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. but what a torture  keener than that of having to keep silence  to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! robert asked himself: what can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? she hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me. and he reproached himself. thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. an immaterial enclosure, i admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. he saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: the letter! the letter! after this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end. he suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. and inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. but his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. he forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. he contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at doncires, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a ladys maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. these communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, roberts mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of versailles. meanwhile he, down at doncires, no longer slept a wink all night. once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. but suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: i hear her; you shant    you shant.     he awoke. he had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. his host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. saint-loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. and suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. he had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. and the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, robert said, he would never be able to forget. it was an idiotic dream, he concluded, still quite breathless. all the same i could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. my father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but i doubt whether that would have been of much use to saint-loup. besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between saint-loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. his bad dream began to fade from his memory. with a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take. at length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. as soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. he did not hesitate for long. and perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to paris at the new year. now he had not the heart to go to paris without seeing her. on the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which captain de borodino was unwilling to grant. im sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. i dare say i shall be in paris at easter. we shant be able to call on mme. de guermantes then, because i shall have gone to balbec. but, really, it doesnt matter in the least, i assure you. to balbec? but you didnt go there till august. i know; but next year theyre making me go there earlier, for my health. all that he feared was that i might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. she is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. but she is a sublime creature. you cant imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. she goes every year to spend all souls day at bruges. nice of her, dont you think? if you ever do meet her youll see what i mean; she has a greatness.     and, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: there is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what i mean, the poet merging into the priest. i was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable saint-loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to paris. now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that i had to see some more pictures by elstir, the famous painter whom saint-loup and i had met at balbec. a pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to elstir, what i had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would i have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which i had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what i wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by elstir. it seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. his work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, i had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (i had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of japanese art. several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. a certain house at les andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which elstirs pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, i felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to mme. de guermantes. so that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which saint-loup told me of his ladys projected visit to bruges, i was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment: listen, if you dont mind. just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. you remember elstir, the painter i met at balbec? why, of course i do. you remember how much i admired his work? i do, quite well; and the letter we sent him. very well, one of the reasons  not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason  why i should like to meet the said lady  you do know who i mean, dont you? of course i do. how involved youre getting. is that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by elstir. i say, i never knew that. elstir will probably be at balbec at easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. i should very much like to have seen this picture before i leave paris. i dont know whether youre on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldnt you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she wont refuse, and then ask her if shell let me come and see the picture without you, since you wont be there? thats all right. ill answer for her; ill make a special point of it. oh, robert, you are an angel; i do love you. its very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do. i hope its not your departure that you two are plotting together, one of roberts friends said to me. you know, if saint-loup does go on leave, it neednt make any difference, we shall still be here. it will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but well do all we can to make you forget his absence. as a matter of fact, just as we had decided that roberts mistress would have to go to bruges by herself, the news came that captain de borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for serjeant saint-loup to proceed on long leave to bruges. what had happened was this. the prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under napoleon iiis barber. captain de borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. but the hairdresser, through whose books the princes account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of portugal and eau des souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for saint-loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. having learned of saint-loups vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. this narrative of a young mans gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of bonapartish indulgence. it is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barbers recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. while his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. as for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to saint-loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to robert again. all his friends assured me that, as long as i stayed at doncires, or if i should come there again at any time, even although robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and i felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness. why on earth, they went on, after insisting that i should stay, dont you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! besides youre so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier. for i continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names i knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, i used to make the other boys classify the actors of the thtre-franais. if, in the place of one of the generals whom i had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as galliffet or ngrier, one of saint-loups friends, with a contemptuous: but ngrier is one of the feeblest of our general officers, put the new, intact, appetising name of pau or geslin de bourgogne, i felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of thiron or febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of amaury. better even than ngrier? but in what respect; give me an example? i should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and i hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. the one whom i should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom i had most often seen, was the prince de borodino. but neither saint-loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include m. de borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards saint-loup. the others, taking advantage of the fact that robert was only an n.c.o., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. captain de borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with robert. the fact was that the prince, whose grandfather had been made a marshal and a prince-duke by the emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of napoleon iii and had twice been a minister after the coup detat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with saint-loup and the guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. he suspected that, for saint-loup, he himself was  he, a kinsman of the hohenzollern  not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded saint-loup as the son of a man whose countship had been confirmed by the emperor  one of what were known in the faubourg saint-germain as touched-up counts  and who had besought him first for a prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to his highness the prince de borodino, minister of state, who was styled on his letters monseigneur and was a nephew of the sovereign. something more than a nephew, possibly. the first princesse de borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on napoleon i, whom she followed to the isle of elba, and the second hers on napoleon iii. and if, in the captains placid countenance, one caught a trace of napoleon i if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask  the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of napoleon iii; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after sedan, to join the emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused. if the prince de borodino was not prepared to make overtures to saint-loup nor to the other representatives of faubourg saint-germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. and so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of saint-loup, the prince de borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by marshal x  confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which saint-loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at doncires, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. i had no difficulty that evening, as i watched saint-loup sitting at his captains table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the empire. the offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, saint-loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the strangers name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him my dear fellow. belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the prince de borodino  not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally  regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom saint-loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. this was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great embassies, and the court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of saint-loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a rouher and a fould. son, doubtless, or grandson of an emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of m. de borodino. but as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. it was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. when he passed in plain clothes through the streets of doncires, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-majors office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by berthier and massna. when he chose the cloth for his squadrons breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling talleyrand and deceiving alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new prussia and a new italy. but a moment later, reverting from napoleon iii to napoleon i, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the mens rations. and at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue svres, fit for an ambassador (which had been given to his father by napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. and, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the prince had at doncires, it may be as well to add these few words. the lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officers wife sang like a conservatoire medallist. this latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with m. de borodino. they were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the prince went to paris on leave he dined with mme. de pourtals, and the murats, and people like that. but, they said to themselves, hes just a captain, after all; hes only too glad to get us to come. still, hes a real friend, you know. but when m. de borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer paris, was posted to beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the doncires theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. one morning, saint-loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between paris and doncires, she might make use of it to speak to me. in short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. the telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. and yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and i almost decided to lodge a complaint. like all of us nowadays i found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmothers case, paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. and we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. we need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke  occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, i admit  the vigilant virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our guardian angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the all powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the danaids of the unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: i hear you!; the ever infuriated servants of the mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the invisible, the young ladies of the telephone. and, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound  the sound of distance overcome  and the voice of the dear one speaks to us. it is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. but how remote it is! how often have i been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, i felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. a real presence indeed that voice so near  in actual separation. but a premonition also of an eternal separation! over and again, as i listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and i have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which i was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words i would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust. this afternoon, alas, at doncires, the miracle did not occur. when i reached the post office, my grandmothers call had already been received; i stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when i raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like punchinello; i silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like punchinello, as soon as i took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. at length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, i stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then i spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly i heard that voice which i supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, i had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself i was hearing this afternoon for the first time. and because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, i discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. it was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost  more than any but a few human voices can ever have been  of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, i noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime. was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. the orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that i felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that i would stay at doncires altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what i held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. my grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. this freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which i had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when i should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). granny! i cried to her, granny! and would fain have kissed her, but i had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. speak to me! but then it happened that, left more solitary still, i ceased to catch the sound of her voice. my grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; i continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which i felt that her appeals also must be straying. i was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, i had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, i had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that i was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which i was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. it seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that i had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, i went on vainly repeating: granny, granny! as orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as i was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to paris, i wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. and yet, before reaching this decision, i felt i must make one attempt more to invoke the daughters of the night, the messengers of the word, the deities without form or feature; but the capricious guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was captain de borodinos nephew); gutenberg and wagram left their supplications unanswered, and i came away, feeling that the invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear. when i came among robert and his friends, i withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. saint-loup appeared to believe me, but i learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. and while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, i certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings i had derived from the friendship of the former and the latters distant passage. and yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. my departure overpowered me less when i was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when i felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, roberts brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between doncires and paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return. i dont doubt the truth of what youre saying, or that you arent thinking of leaving us just yet, said saint-loup, smiling; but pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise theres a risk of my not seeing you; im going out to luncheon, ive got leave from the captain; i shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. i suppose the man to whose house im going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time. scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. i ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. the word trunks recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. i was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. the office was closing for the night. finally i got my connexion. is that you, granny? a womans voice, with a strong english accent, answered: yes, but i dont know your voice. neither did i recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. and then all was explained. the young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. this call coming on the very day on which i had been telephoning to my grandmother, i had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error. the following morning i rose late, and failed to catch saint-loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. about half past one, i had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as i was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, i noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an n.c.o. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was saint-loup. by his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom i had met once before at the hotel where we dined. i did not dare shout to robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, i attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. i knew that robert was short-sighted; still, i should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. i ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when i arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which i was not allowed to stand, and i was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to saint-loup; i went up to his room, but he had gone; i was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the old soldiers, who were watching the regiment parade. you havent seen serjeant saint-loup, have you, by any chance? i asked. hes gone on parade, sir, said the old soldier. i never saw him, said the graduate. you never saw him, exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, you never saw our famous saint-loup, the figure hes cutting with his new breeches! when the capstan sees that, officers cloth, my word! oh, youre a wonder, you are; officers cloth, replied the young graduate, who, reported sick in quarters, was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. this officers cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it? sir? asked the old soldier angrily. he was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches being made of officers cloth, but, being a breton, coming from a village that went by the name of penguern-stereden, having learned french with as much difficulty as if it had been english or german, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying sir? to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation. ah! it is cloth like that, he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. ah! it is cloth like that; when i tell you that it is, officers cloth, when-i-tell-you-a-thing, if-i-tell-you-a-thing, its because i know, i should think. very well, then; replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. keep your hair on, old boy. there, look, theres the capstan coming along. no, but just look at saint-loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. would you call that a non-com? and his eyeglass; oh, hes hot stuff, he is. i asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether i too might look out of the window. they neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. i saw captain de borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the battle of austerlitz. a few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as i was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. i was wretched at not having said good-bye to saint-loup, but i went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when i thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, i had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, i had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what i had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as i had once before imagined mamma in a house by herself, when i had left her to go to balbec. alas, this phantom was just what i did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, i found her there, reading. i was in the room, or rather i was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. of myself  thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of ones own absence  there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. the process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when i caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. we never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. how, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother i had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could i have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. but if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. so is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. and, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of egypt, i, for whom my grandmother was still myself, i who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say hes begun to age a good deal, for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, i saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom i did not know. my request to be allowed to inspect the elstirs in mme. de guermantess collection had been met by saint-loup with: i will answer for her. and indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. we answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. no doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another persons nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. but these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. and so with the actions which before our minds eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. one of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which saint-loup still did not come to paris, his aunt, to whom i had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the elstirs. i perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. this was jupien. did he consider that i ought to have gone in and said how dye do to him, on my return from doncires, before even going upstairs to our own flat? my mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. franoise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. these invariably passed off after a little time. meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. one morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, i heard in my chimney  instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea  the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. that morning, i was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which i had been going to florence and venice. so profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom i was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing. i quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to balbec that on my arrival there i had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before i knew it; that at florence or parma or venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when i looked at the sights there. i realised this. similarly, one new years afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, i had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. and yet i could not prevent my memory of the time during which i had looked forward to spending easter in florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the city of flowers, to give at once to easter day something florentine and to florence something paschal. easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of holy week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun. the weather had now become milder. and my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. i had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting mme. de guermantes. but it was for this very reason that i kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with mme. de guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, i should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning. alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, i felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. it happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. but the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. and she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. and so, even when i had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, i trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, i would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides. she was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. i said to myself that the woman whom i could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; i saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that i should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painters brush. and when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. on one of these lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, i met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. the face of mme. de guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. i was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. the gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which i did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some saint of the early ages of christianity. after which i felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. but, after all, the streets are public. the streets are public, i reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of italy, the duchesse de guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. as i had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. there is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. but in these afternoon hours both were lacking. before going to sleep, i devoted so much time to thinking that i should not be able to sleep, that even after i was asleep a little of my thought remained. it was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that i could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that i had had the idea that i was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening    to a fresh doze in which i was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when i was asleep, i had imagined that i was not asleep. these shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen  and quite useless  delicacy of perception to seize them all. similarly, in later years, at venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, i have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. one of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. in my sleep i saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. an arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. this dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which i longed to attain, in which i believed that i was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that i had often dreamed it before. but as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, i supposed that i was mistaken. i noticed, however, that i did frequently have this dream. the limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; i could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. i, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while i dreamed, as soon as i tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; i wanted to go to them, and i could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly i was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. so, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which giotto has portrayed envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which swann had given me photographs. saint-loup came to paris for a few hours only. he came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. shes not being at all nice just now, oriane isnt, he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. shes not my old oriane any longer, theyve gone and changed her. i assure you, its not worth while bothering your head about her. you pay her far too great a compliment. you wouldnt care to meet my cousin poictiers? he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. quite an intelligent young woman, she is; youd like her. shes married to my cousin, the duc de poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. ive told her about you. she said i was to bring you to see her. shes much better looking than oriane, and younger, too. really a nice person, dont you know, really a good sort. these were expressions recently  and all the more ardently  taken up by robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. i dont go so far as to say shes a dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: if he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the devils isle. you see what i mean, dont you? and then shes the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; shes given orders that theyre never to be sent in by the servants stair, when they come to the house. shes a very good sort, i assure you. the real reason why oriane doesnt like her is that she feels shes the cleverer of the two. although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the guermantes footmen  who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge  franoise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of saint-loups visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. she never failed to go out on the days when i most wanted her. it was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in paris. the intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that i felt at being deprived of her services, for i had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at saint-andr-des-champs. and so i never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way franoise had of saying not: i have been to see my brother, or i have been to see my niece, but i have been to see the brother, i just looked in as i passed to bid good day to the niece (or to my niece the butcheress). as for her daughter, franoise would have been glad to see her return to combray. but this recent parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of the intran. she was still less willing to go to franchises sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for mountains, said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, arent really interesting. she could not make up her mind to go back to msglise, where the people are so stupid, where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say why, its never poor bazireaus daughter? she would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had tasted the life of paris, and franoise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new parisian when she said: very well, mother, if you dont get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu. the weather had turned chilly again. go out? what for? to catch your death? said franoise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at combray. being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt lonie  a natural philosopher  franoise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: it is the remnant of the wrath of god! but i responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already i could see the morning sun shine on the slope of fiesole, i warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. it was not only the bells that came from italy, italy had come with them. my faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which i ought to have made long ago, for since, here in paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the ponte vecchio. my father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend a. j., where m. de norpois was going when he met him about the place. its to see mme. de villeparisis, they are great friends; i never knew anything about it. it seems shes a delightful person, a most superior woman. you ought to go and call on her, he told me. another thing that surprised me very much. he spoke to me of m. de guermantes as quite a distinguished man; i had always taken him for a boor. it seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only hes very proud of his name and his connexions. but for that matter, according to norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over europe. it appears, the austrian emperor and the tsar treat him just like one of themselves. old norpois told me that mme. de villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. he paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. for youre not likely to do anything else; i can see that. it might turn out quite a good career; its not what i should have chosen for you, myself; but youll be a man in no time now, we shant always be here to look after you, and we mustnt prevent you from following your vocation. if only i had been able to start writing! but whatever the conditions in which i approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. i was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if i offered them no resistance, if i contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, i escaped without serious injury, i slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, i read a little, i did not over-exert myself; but if i attempted to thwart them, if i pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, i was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and i vowed that another time i would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered. my father, in the meantime, had met m. de guermantes once or twice, and, now that m. de norpois had told him that the duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. as it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed mme. de villeparisis. he tells me, shes his aunt; viparisi, he pronounces it. he tells me, too, shes an extraordinarily able woman. in fact he said she kept a school of wit, my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. my mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that mme. de villeparisis kept a school of wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the marquises intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. my grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. since we had moved into our new flat, mme. de villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. and invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed franoise to lick the envelopes for her. as for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this school of wit, i should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, i eventually did. my father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the ambassadors support would be worth many votes to him at the institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. to tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have m. de norpoiss support, he was by no means certain of it. he had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the ministry that m. de norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my fathers candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. and yet, when m. leroy-beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned m. de norpois. he dared not ask the ambassador point-blank, but hoped that i should return from my call on mme. de villeparisis with his election as good as secured. this call was now imminent. that m. de norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the academy seemed to him all the more probable since the ambassadors willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. and besides, at the ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official. my father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. in the street one day he ran into mme. sazerat, whose life in paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. there was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did mme. sazerat, so much so that mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: my dear, i really must invite mme. sazerat to the house, just once; she wont stay long; and even: listen, dear, i am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon mme. sazerat. you know i hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you. he would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. and so, for all that mme. sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment mme. sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. my father had come home speechless with rage. next day my mother met mme. sazerat in some ones house. she did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all ones relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. now, from all time my parents had accorded to mme. sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. but (and of this my mother was ignorant) mme. sazerat, alone of her kind at combray, was a dreyfusard. my father, a friend of m. mline, was convinced that dreyfus was guilty. he had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. he never spoke to me for a week, after learning that i had chosen to take a different line. his opinions were well known. he came near to being looked upon as a nationalist. as for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. my mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that i might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. finally my grandfather, who adored the army (albeit his duties with the national guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. all this was quite enough to make mme. sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of injustice. we pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. as soon as she knew my father to be an anti-dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between. saint-loup, who was coming anyhow to paris, had promised to take me to mme. de villeparisiss, where i hoped, though i had not said so to him, that we might meet mme. de guermantes. he invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. we were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of paris. i had asked saint-loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which aim had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the balbec season started. it was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of balbec but of balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in paris would be watching, just the same, through the long july afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. i hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with balbec, to have realised here in paris something of the delights of travel. i left the house early, with franoise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. franoise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place. before reaching saint-loups, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, i ran into legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. seeing me, he stopped: ah! so its you, he exclaimed, a man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! that is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. it is true that you are a man of the world, i suppose, and go out paying calls! to go and dream, as i do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. you know how i admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why i tell you how deeply i regret that you should go forth and deny it among the gentiles. by being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere  which i am unable to breathe  of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the prophet. i can see it all, you frequent the light hearts, the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. ah! those aristocrats! the terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. they are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! while you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. the truth is that i scarcely belong to this earth upon which i feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. i belong to a different planet. goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the danube. to prove to you that i am your sincere well-wisher, i am going to send you my last novel. but you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de sicle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. i suppose i am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; i do wrong to put my heart into what i write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of christ: do this and ye shall live. farewell, friend. it was not with any particular resentment against legrandin that i parted from him. certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the vivonne. after coming out of a paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to saint-loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. it was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by nature. the bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. but the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion. it had been a country village, and had kept its old mayors office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. these villages in the environs of paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the follies of the stewards and favourites of the great. a fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that i had seen, formed great quadrilaterals  separated by low walls  of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a palace of the sun, such as one might unearth in crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower. never had robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. she alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. that alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. i do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but i do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. there was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. so nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. if one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, i doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. if he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. for he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. no doubt the general affection called love must have forced him  as it forces all men  to believe at times that she did. but in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really  he thought) to leave him. if she is nice to me to-day, he confided to me, i am going to give her something that shell like. its a necklace she saw at boucherons. its rather too much for me just at present  thirty thousand francs. but, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. she will be jolly pleased with it, i know. she mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. i don t believe that is true, really, but i wasnt taking any risks, so ive arranged with boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. i am glad to think that youre going to meet her; shes nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know, (i could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when i did see her, admire her all the more) what she has got is a marvellous judgment; shell perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by jove! the things shell say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; theres really something about her thats quite pythian. on our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and i was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths. listen; i can see youd rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it, said robert, so just wait for me here, will you; my friends house is quite close, i will go and fetch her. while i waited i strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. if i raised my head i could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. i recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to m. swanns park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. i took a path which led me into a meadow. a cold wind blew keenly along it, as at combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the suns face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the suns rays. suddenly saint-loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman i recognised at once rachel when from the lord, her who, but a few years since  women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change  used to say to the procuress: to-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, wont you? and when they had come round for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the anyone, she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent womans precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound ones chest, never stopping in the process unless the some one, not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patients catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. on this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them i should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, i felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of saint-loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make  out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more  the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. seeing these two elements separately (because i had known rachel when from the lord in a house of ill fame), i realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what rachel was for me. the idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. i could have told robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. and how they would have pained him! and what had he not given to learn them, without avail! i realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girls face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. i saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than ones family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. no doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, robert and i. but we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. that face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, i had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that i asked. and so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. and beneath them i should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. but what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. he gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. that he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. it happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in ones judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying ones chances of platonic love. and it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. as for rachels favours, however, saint-loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge  since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law  from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. the immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. and indeed, when robert and i were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery. it was not rachel when from the lord who seemed to me a small matter  it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these i felt to be vast. robert noticed that i appeared moved. i turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. and it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. these trees that i had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the magdalenes when, in another garden, she saw a human form and thought it was the gardener. treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? i exchanged a few words with saint-loups mistress. we cut across the village. its houses were sordid. but by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. saint-loup drew me a little way in front to explain. i should have liked it if you and i could have been alone together, in fact i would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunts. but this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, dont you know, i hadnt the heart to refuse her. youll like her, however, shes literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides its such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing. i fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. we had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to paris when, at the station, rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little tarts like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: hello, rachel, you come with us; lucienne and germaine are in the train, and theres room for one more. come on. were all going to the rink, and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. they were two poor little tarts with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as rachel must have looked when saint-loup first met her. he did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to rachel, he caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a rachel other than her whom he knew, a rachel like the two little tarts in the train, a twenty-franc rachel. in short, rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own rachel, the little tart rachel, the real rachel, assuming that rachel the tart was more real than the other. it may then have occurred to robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. but how was it to be done? she had done nothing to forfeit his regard. less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. if he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on rachels part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say  and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands  that this was from self-esteem or vanity. saint-loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. no; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in ones own eyes and in other peoples as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. rachel rejoined us, leaving the two tarts to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names lucienne and germaine kept the new rachel alive for a moment longer. for a moment robert imagined a place pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the boulevard de clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. it was almost an unknown paris in the heart of paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. robert longed to ask her who lucienne and germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the olympia tavern, if robert and i had not been there. for a moment the purlieus of the olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the rue caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known robert, rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. but what use was it to ply rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. the porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; rachels magnificent pearls reminded robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto  save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the place pigalle of an impressionist painter  and the train began to move. it was, by the way, quite true that she was literary. she never stopped talking to me about books, new art and tolstoyism except to rebuke saint-loup for drinking so much wine: ah! if you could live with me for a year, wed see a fine change. i should keep you on water and youd be ever so much better. right you are. lets begin now. but you know quite well i have to work all day! for she took her art very seriously. besides, what would your people say? and she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which saint-loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. i, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. tears sprang to the young womans eyes; i had been rash enough to refer to dreyfus. the poor martyr! she almost sobbed; it will be the death of him in that dreadful place. dont upset yourself, zzette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit theyve made a mistake. but long before then hell be dead! oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. but just think of the agony he must be going through; thats what makes my heart bleed. and would you believe that roberts mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the devils isle, even if he is innocent; isnt it appalling? yes, its absolutely true, she does say that, robert assured me. shes my mother, ive no fault to find with her, but its quite clear she hasnt got a sensitive nature, like zzette. as a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be such a pleasure always ended in trouble. for as soon as saint-loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. in fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. and sometimes she found that robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. i could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that robert was looking troubled. the fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, aim, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. the others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of college of augurs. as ill luck would have it, aim having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. aim inquired after my grandmothers health; i asked for news of his wife and children. he gave it with emotion, being a family man. he had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. roberts mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. but aims sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. in the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of prince eugne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. he had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. at the most, some passing parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. and yet aim must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. anyhow, it did not escape robert beneath whose skin i saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused. anything specially interesting about that waiter, zzette? he inquired, after sharply dismissing aim. one would think you were studying the part. there you are, beginning again; i knew it was coming. beginning what again, my dear girl? i may have been mistaken; i havent said anything, im sure. but i have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that i knew him at balbec (otherwise i shouldnt give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesnt walk the face of the earth. she seemed anxious to pacify robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. i found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that i most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as i had heard mme. de villeparisis declare that she had no talent, i attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. she discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. she applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if wagnerian, ah! that is good! one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: yes, as a sensation i call it distinctly good. but what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal. in eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. she recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own. i ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic rachel was too malicious for my liking. she did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration  against saint-loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing rachel attack her  the defence of berma, saying: oh, no, shes a wonderful person, really. of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they dont correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. she has done good work, you know. and besides shes such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesnt care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind. (our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. if it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out ones thumb. but the charming quality of mind is more exacting. it requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) but, with this single exception, saint-loups mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because i believed  quite mistakenly, as it happened  that it was she who was inferior to them. she was clearly aware that i must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. but she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (i was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see saint-loups mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) and so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyones conversation delighted her so much as mine. if we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the palais-royal; they had a look, also, of academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that m. de jussieu might have worn. others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which members of the institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. they were faces well known to all the regular guests. one of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. but presently, perhaps to drive robert away so that she might be alone with aim, rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table. zzette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that, said saint-loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, if you must make a scene here, i shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards. at this point a messenger came up to tell aim that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. saint-loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, m. de charlus. there; you see! he said to me in a low voice, my family hunt me down even here. will you, please  i cant very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and hes certain to give us away  ask him not to go to the carriage. he can ahvays send some other waiter who doesnt know me. i know my uncle; if they tell him that im not known here, hell never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. really, its pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me! aim on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the marquis de saint-loup) that they did not know any such person. but saint-loups mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage. oh, indeed! so its the young man over there, now, is it? thank you for telling me; its a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with ones meals! dont listen to him, please; hes rather cross to-day, and, you know, she went on, turning to me, he just says it because he thinks it smart, that its the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always. and she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation. but, zzette, it is i who find it unpleasant. you are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine youre making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too. oh, no, i think hes charming; for one thing, hes got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women  you can feel he must love them. you can at least keep quiet until ive left the room, if you have lost your senses, cried robert. waiter, my things. i did not know whether i was expected to follow him. no, i want to be alone, he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. his anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. when robert had gone, his mistress called aim and asked him various questions. she then wanted to know what i thought of him. an amusing expression, hasnt he? do you know what i should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. but that would be all. if we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldnt it? its silly of robert to get ideas like that. all that sort of thing, its only just what comes into my head, thats all; robert has nothing to worry about. she was still gazing at aim. do look, what dark eyes he has. i should love to know what there is behind them. presently came a message that robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. i thus found myself alone, until i too was summoned by robert. i found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. they were drinking champagne. hallo, you! she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. i had fed badly, i was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit legrandins words had had no effect on me i was sorry to think that i was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. whereupon i said to myself: i have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young womans company are not wasted, since i have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne. i told myself this because i felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. i ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which i felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that i was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. as for robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. they made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. by dint of drinking champagne with them, i began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication  and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart  lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. the room which saint-loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the jardin de paris. being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, i caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. the joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado i smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. and i felt myself so much under the ephemeral and potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that i am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom i had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that i should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life. robert was annoyed only because i was not being more brilliant before his mistress. what about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, ive forgotten the story, and he watched her furtively. but, my dear boy, theres nothing more than what youve just said. what a bore you are. then tell her about franoise in the champs-elyses. shell enjoy that. oh, do! bobby is always talking about franoise. and taking saint-loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: hallo, you! since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; i amused myself, pretending that what i saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that saint-loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, i saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for i could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part. these ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedians face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us  like the dissolution of a dear friend  begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death. one number in the programme i found extremely trying. a young woman whom rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. this young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. at the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. the unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. the instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. i tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than i had paid to my grandmothers sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. and yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. nevertheless, i preferred not to speak of this incident since i had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy. but the opening scene of this afternoons performance interested me in quite another way. it made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which saint-loup was a victim with regard to rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and i respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. but seen thus, she was another woman. she had one of those faces to which distance  and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre  gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. at a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of rachels attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. this was not my case but it had been saint-loups when he first saw her on the stage. then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm  that in which she lived  from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. he had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. the number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. the golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon rachel before saint-loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. they vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. but she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. and so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in roberts memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. she was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to saint-loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. he loved her already. the need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all ones chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre. when, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, i felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with saint-loup. in this way my attitude, as i did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that i was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that i should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what i appeared to be saying, i was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind: you know, i said, i did come to say good-bye to you the day i left doncires; ive not had an opportunity to mention it. i waved to you in the street. dont speak about it, he replied, i was so sorry. i passed you just outside the barracks, but i couldnt stop because i was late already. i assure you, i felt quite wretched about it. so he had recognised me! i saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. but i was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. i had already observed at balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. in one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute. the stage scenery, still in its place, among which i was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and rachel, when i came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. the curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. it was no longer herself, i recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. the form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. on the other hand  as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold  on this face, so smooth a surface until now, i could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, i was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by goethe in wilhelm meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and i had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with ones eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. but at that moment saint-loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened. you might look the other way, he warned her gloomily. you know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and theyre the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that youve taken notice of them. besides, you know very well youve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. youll be missing your call again. a group of men  journalists  noticing the look of fury on saint-loups face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. and as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them. oh, but i know him; hes a friend of mine, cried saint-loups mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. look how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body! the dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child. oh, thats too lovely, the way he copies himself, she cried, clapping her hands. i implore you, my dearest girl, saint-loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, do not make a scene here, i cant stand it; i swear, if you say another word i wont go with you to your room, i shall walk straight out; come, dont be so naughty.    you oughtnt to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, itll make you ill, he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our balbec days. oh! what a good thing it would be if you did go. i warn you, if i do i shant come back. thats more than i should venture to hope. listen; you know, i promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this.     ah! well, that doesnt surprise me in the least. you gave me your promise; i ought to have known youd never keep it. you want the whole world to know youre made of money, but im not a money-grubber like you. you can keep your blasted necklace; i know some one else wholl give it to me. no one else can possibly give it to you; ive told boucheron hes to keep it for me, and i have his promise not to let anyone else have it. there you are, trying to blackmail me, youve arranged everything, i see. thats what they mean by marsantes, mater semita, it smells of the race, retorted rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for semita means path and not semite, but one which the nationalists applied to saint-loup on account of the dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. she was less entitled than anyone to apply the word jew to mme. de marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of judaism apart from her connexion with the lvy-mirepoix family. but this isnt the last of it, i can tell you. an agreement like that isnt binding. you have acted treacherously towards me. boucheron shall be told of it and hell be paid twice as much for his necklace. youll hear from me before long; dont you worry. robert was in the right a hundred times over. but circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. and i could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at balbec: in that way i keep a hold over her. you dont understand what i mean about the necklace. i made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, its only natural, surely, that i shouldnt give it to you; i fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. you cant seriously maintain that i brag about my money, im always telling you that im only a poor devil without a cent to my name. its foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. what possible interest can i have in hurting you? you know very well that my one interest in life is yourself. oh, yes, yes, please go on, she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. and turning to watch the dancer: isnt he too wonderful with his hands. a woman like me couldnt do the things hes doing now. she went closer to him and, pointing to roberts furious face: look, hes hurt, she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for saint-loup. listen, for the last time, i swear to you it doesnt matter what you do  in a week youll be giving anything to get me back  i shant come; its a clean cut, do you hear, its irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when its too late. perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances. but, my dear boy, he went on, to me, you oughtnt to stand about here, i tell you, it will make you cough. i pointed to the scenery which barred my way. he touched his hat and said to one of the journalists: would you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend. his mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and: do they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands? she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. you look just like one yourself, im sure i could have a wonderful time with you and a girl i know. theres no rule against smoking that i know of; if people arent well, they have only to stay at home, said the journalist. the dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress. oh! do stop! youll make me quite mad, she cried to him. then there will be trouble. in any case, sir, you are not very civil, observed saint-loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed. at that moment i saw saint-loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom i could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed  without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante  after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalists cheek. now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, i should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one anothers blood. but what i could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how saint-loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. as for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: good heavens, i believe the curtains going up; we shant get into our seats. i wanted to speak to saint-loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the play necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. the journalists friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. but, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. and so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speakers brother. indeed they seemed quite to resent their friends not having shared their several emotions. what, didnt it strike you? you must be going blind. what i say is that youre a pack of curs, growled the journalist whom saint-loup had punished. forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought  but they did not think of it  to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: whats all the excitement? keep your hair on, old chap. dont take the bit in your teeth. i had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which roberts love for rachel when from the lord was based; i was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. i had stopped for a moment at a corner of the avenue gabriel from which i had often in the past seen gilberte appear. i tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a gymnastic pace to overtake saint-loup when i saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. i concluded that this was a personal friend of robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, i saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before saint-loups face and body, a flickering constellation. flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. they were merely, however, saint-loups pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this  to all appearance ideal and decorative  arrangement. but this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which saint-loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. he gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that saint-loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. saint-loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. the incident was in no way connected (as i had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. it was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that saint-loup was, had made overtures to him. my friend could not get over the audacity of this clique who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of paris. and yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. now, that saint-loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. and so, although saint-loups arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals. these incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in robert a desire to be left alone for a while. after a moments silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on mme. de villeparisis. he would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me. as i had supposed before making the acquaintance of mme. de villeparisis at balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of mme. de guermantes. mme. de villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. certainly i had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how mme. de villeparisis, at balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through spain which my father was then making with m. de norpois. even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy  of more than twenty years standing  between mme. de villeparisis and the ambassador could have been responsible for the ladys loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the marquise than just an old friend. had mme. de villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? that sharp tongue which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? all this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which  giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation  mme. de villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. that generation is reflected in them but is not continued. instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. and whether or not there had been in the life of mme. de villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation. it is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which mme. de villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word restraint is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; i had remarked at balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to mme. de villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. but this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves  on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces  true artistic qualities. now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. what artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. and yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the memoirs which she afterwards published, mme. de villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. but a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. in a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. and between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open mme. de villeparisiss memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old marquise on the staircases of the embassies by a snob like mme. leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors or solicitors wives whom she would find there. a bluestocking mme. de villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets. moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a complete woman. it is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for ones own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of ones social relations. i had seen at balbec mme. de villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. but i had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. she would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the faubourg saint-germain. to the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. certainly, if at a given moment in her youth mme. de villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. she had wished to shew the duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. but now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. she would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. how many womens lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. flung on the wind in what way? the young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable marquise de villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period mme. de villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. in the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. we are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. the disdainful bow of mme. leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of mme. de villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition. no doubt at the same moment at which mme. leroi was  to use an expression beloved of mme. swann cutting the marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how queen marie-amlie had once said to her: you are just like a daughter to me. but such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old conservatoire medalist. the only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. and for all that she could remember the queens using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which mme. leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day. it must be remarked, however, that in mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room the absence of mme. leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. they were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which mme. leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that mme. de villeparisiss receptions were, as the readers of her memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in paris. on the occasion of this first call which, after leaving saint-loup, i went to pay on mme. villeparisis, following the advice given by m. de norpois to my father, i found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. side by side with the guermantes and villeparisis portraits one saw those  gifts from the sitters themselves  of queen marie-amlie, the queen of the belgians, the prince de joinville and the empress of austria. mme. de villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a breton inn-keeper who, however parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florists counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. in this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when i arrived a librarian with whom mme. de villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the duchesse de montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. it was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. but, for one thing, the anti-dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. in the second place, mme. de villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the case and never gave it a thought. lastly, a young man like bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. he had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. the rumanians, the egyptians, the turks may hate the jews. but in a french drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaenas, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound salaams, completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. only it is essential that the jew should not be actually in society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of mascarilles nose than of solomons. but bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with england or spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his european costume, as one of decampss jews. marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at susa before the gates of the palace of darius. (later in the afternoon bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that m. de charlus inquired whether his first name was jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) but, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from jews, greeks, persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. we know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient greeks, we have seen assyrians on the walls of a palace at susa. and so we feel, on encountering in a paris drawing-room orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. we knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. the young greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a turkish lady or a jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. it is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which  up to the present, at any rate  the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient greeks, of the ancient hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. in the young greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. i felt that if i had in the light of mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room taken photographs of bloch, they would have furnished of israel the same image  so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity  which we find in spirit photographs. there is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the infinite utters only these words  the same that had just issued from the lips of bloch: take care of my top hat. oh, ministers, my dear sir, mme. de villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: nobody ever wanted to see them. i was only a child at the time, but i can remember so well the king begging my grandfather to invite m. decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the duchesse de berry. it will give me pleasure, florimond, said the king. my grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said m. de castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. when he understood that it was m. decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to m. decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. for we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it tea or dancing or music. but if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. m. decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. he had obeyed the king, but he had not had m. decazes at his ball.    yes, sir, i remember m. mole very well, he was a clever man  he shewed that in his reception of m. de vigny at the academy  but he was very pompous, and i can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand. ah! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry ones hat in ones hand in ones own house, observed bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: there, you see what shes like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, shes quite amazing. oh, dear, no, replied mme. de villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, it was a habit m. mole had; that was all. i never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the king came, because the king being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room. aristotle tells us in the second chapter of     ventured m. pierre, the historian of the fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other peoples lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. he sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by mr. wells. fortunately he had found mme. de villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait. meanwhile he was cut short by bloch. indeed, the latter remarked, referring to what mme. de villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. do you know, i never knew that, as though it were strange that he should not have known it always. talking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew basin played on me yesterday morning? mme. de villeparisis asked the librarian. he told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the queen of sweden who had called to see me. what! he made them tell you just like that! i say, he must have a nerve, exclaimed bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity. i was quite surprised, because i had only been back from the country a few days; i had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that i was in paris, and i asked myself how the queen of sweden could have heard so soon, went on mme. de villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the queen of sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess. earlier in the day mme. de villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom mme. de villeparisis was at home, and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as mme. leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the authors disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. in the opinion of mme. leroi, mme. de villeparisiss parties were third-rate; and mme. de villeparisis felt the sting of mme. lerois opinion. but hardly anyone to-day remembers who mme. leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, frequented as it was by the queen of sweden, and as it had been by the due daumale, the duc de broglie, thiers, montalembert, mgr. dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of homer and pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men. now of all this mme. de villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories  sometimes slightly touched up by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. and then there was m. de norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or french statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to mme. de villeparisis. possibly mme. leroi also knew these european celebrities. but, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the eastern question to her prime ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. love? she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: what are your views on love?love? i make it, constantly, but i never talk about it. when she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the duchesse de guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. they often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which mme. de villeparisis forced them to engage. but these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the memoirs of mme. de villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in corneilles tragedies. furthermore, the parties of the villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. and if the literary bent of the villeparisis is the cause of the lerois disdain, the disdain of the lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. god, whose will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the lerois, for he knows that if these should invite the villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight. presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of marie-antoinette. i did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in parisian society and who, like mme. de villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were ikjw lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. each of these ladies had her own duchesse de guermantes, the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the duchesse de guermantes of either of the others. mme. de villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. furthermore, the lady with the mark-antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on mme. de villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the duchesse de guermantes did not come to her fridays. her consolation was that at these same fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the princesse de poix, who was her own personal guermantes, and who never went near mme. de villeparisis, albeit mme. de poix was an intimate friend of the duchess. nevertheless from the mansion on the quai malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the rue de tournon, the rue de la chaise and the faubourg saint-honor, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom i would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one anothers society. besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. how should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a duc de sagan or a prince de ligne? especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. indeed these old ladies men about town nephews  and saint-loup the foremost of them  when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once i will take you to see my aunt villeparisis, (or whichever it was) you meet interesting people there. they knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when i objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. the misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that i was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. in a word, these three parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. i felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the greeks who created icarus, theseus, heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. but one does not tabulate the sum of a persons vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. in that gallery of symbolical figures which is society, the really light women, the true messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the pope regularly sends his golden rose, and who as often as not has written  on the early days of lamartine  an essay that has been crowned by the french academy. how dye do, alix? mme. de villeparisis greeted the marie-antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for mme. de villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. thus mme. de villeparisis took good care not to introduce bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the quai malaquais. besides it was only tit for tat. for, the evening before, the old lady had had mme. ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that mme. de villeparisis, from whom she had filched the italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. so that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. mme. de villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of bloch, made me known to the marie-antoinette of the quai malaquais. the latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades  and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances  just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if i had not existed. by this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring mme. de villeparisis: you see, im nowhere near him; please understand that im not interested  in any sense of the word, you old cat  in little boys. but when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name  she had been born a choiseul, moreover  had a prodigious effect on me. i understand, sir, that you are thinkin of writin somethin about mme. la duchesse de montmorency, said mme. de villeparisis to the historian of the fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: im goin to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the louvre. she rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the duchesse de montmorency, abbess of one of the most famous chapters in the east of france. everyone had risen. what is rather amusin, said our hostess, is that in these chapters where our great-aunts were so often made abbesses, the daughters of the king of france would not have been admitted. they were very close corporations. not admit the kings daughters, cried bloch in amazement, why ever not? why, because the house of france had not enough quartering after that low marriage. blochs bewilderment increased. a low marriage? the house of france? when was that? why, when they married into the medicis, replied mme. de villeparisis in the most natural manner. its a fine picture, aint it, and in a perfect state of preservation, she added. my dear, put in the marie-antoinette lady, surely you remember that when i brought liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy. i should bow to any opinion of liszt on music, but not on painthe besides, he was quite off his head then, and i dont remember his ever saying anything of the sort. but it wasnt you that brought him here. i had met him any number of times at dinner at princess sayn-wittgensteins. alixs shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. and, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park. ah, i see another fine portrait, began the historian. the door opened and the duchesse de guermantes entered the room. well, how are you? mme. de villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: that is the portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld.     a young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver. it is that gentleman who has been several times to see mme. la marquise. did you tell him i was at home? he heard the voices. oh, very well then, shew him in. its a man who was introduced to me, she explained. he told me he was very anxious to come to the house. i certainly never said he might. but here hes taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesnt do to hurt peoples feelings. sir, she went on to me, and you, sir, to the historian of the fronde, let me introduce my niece, the duchesse de guermantes. the historian made a low bow, as i did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of mme. de guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention. the importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for mme. de villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was legrandin. thank you so very much for letting me come and see you, he began, laying stress on the word very. it is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; i assure you that its repercussion     he stopped short on catching sight of me. i was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the maxims; its a family picture. mme. de guermantes meanwhile had greeted alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. i hear all about you from madeleine, she added. she was at luncheon with me to-day, said the marquise of the quai malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that mme. de villeparisis could never say that. meanwhile i had been talking to bloch, and fearing, from what i had been told of his fathers change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, i said to him that his must be the happier of the two. my remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. but such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. yes, i do lead a delightful existence, bloch assured me with a beatified smile. i have three great friends; i do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; i am infinitely happy. rare is the mortal to whom father zeus accords so much felicity. i fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. it was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: oh, it was nothing, really, and so forth, when, to my question: was it a good show? put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which i had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: why, yes, it was quite a good show, couldnt have been better. it was really charming! what you have just told us interests me enormously, said legrandin to mme. de villeparisis, for i was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which i will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. i should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but i shall remember them. they are, in a phrase which comes, i think, from joubert, friends of the memery. you have never read joubert? oh! he would have admired you so! i will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. he had not your strength. but he had a great deal of charm all the same. i would have gone up to legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that i might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to mme. de villeparisis. she shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian. and this is the famous marie de rohan, duchesse de chevreuse, who was married first of all to m. de luynes. my dear, speaking of mme. de luynes reminds me of yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if i had known that you werent engaged id have sent round to ask you to come. mme. ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by queen carmen sylva in the authors presence. it was too beautiful! what treachery! thought mme. de villeparisis. of course that was what she was whispering about the other day to mme. de beaulaincourt and mme. de chaponay. i had no engagement, she replied, but i should not have come. i heard ristori in her great days, shes a mere wreck now. besides i detest carmen sylvas poetry. ristori came here once, the duchess of aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the inferno, by dante. in that sort of thing shes incomparable. alix bore the blow without flinching. she remained marble. her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. but the surface of one cheek was scaling. a faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. perhaps another winter would level her with the dust. now, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of mme, de montmorency, mme. de villeparisis said to legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again. seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, mme. de guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt. its m. legrandin, murmured mme. de villeparisis, he has a sister called mme. de cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me. what! oh, but i know her quite well! exclaimed mme. de guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. that is to say, i dont know her, but for some reason or other basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. and she did. i cant tell you what it was like. she informed me that she had been to london, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the british museum. and this very day, the moment i leave your house, im going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. and dont for a moment suppose that its an easy thing to do. on the pretence that shes dying of some disease shes always at home, it doesnt matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, shes ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts. no, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity, mme. de guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. shes an impossible person, she talks about plumitives and things like that. what does plumitive mean? asked mme. de villeparisis. i havent the slightest idea! cried the duchess in mock indignation. i dont want to know. i dont speak that sort of language. and seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of mme. de cambremer: why, of course, she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, everybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. but its a dreadful word. its enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. nothing will ever make me use words like that. and so thats the brother, is it? i hadnt realized that yet. but after all its not inconceivable. she has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. shes just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. yes, im beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly. sit down, were just going to take a dish of tea, said mme. de villeparisis to her niece. help yourself; you dont want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as i do. presently mme. de villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. the rest of the party gathered round her, and i took the opportunity to go up to legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in mme. de villeparisiss drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that i had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: well, sir, i am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when i find you here too. m. legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that i was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief. you might at least have the civility to begin by saying how dye do to me, he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which i had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. what happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. and suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. i knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the academy. but really legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this. naturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere, he went on in lower tones, although i am perfectly free to do what i choose, still i cant behave like an absolute boor. mme. de guermantes had sat down. her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. i felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks  which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name guermantes  was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. later on, when she had ceased to interest me, i came to know many of the duchesss peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which i already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in france, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at combray or the pastry-cooks in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. but on this first day i discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that i might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which i should have found some indication of the name guermantes. in any case, i told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title duchesse de guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that i thought i could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. perhaps i should have been not quite so deeply stirred had i met her at mme. de villeparisiss at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the marquises days, at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoons outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: mme. de guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round combray where i had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when mme. de guermantes drove through them, in the rue de la paix. with a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that mme. de guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust. that admirable writer g-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on mme. de villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. the duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. he was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, mme. de guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with royalties who were curious to meet him. for the duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctors orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. it was true that these eminent men used to see at the guermantes the princesse de parme, the princesse de sagan (whom franoise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, the sagante), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the due de guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. others more simple still thought that perhaps the duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. the better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the duchesss marvellous brain, assumed that she must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. and it was true that the duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. but the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. for she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. if, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with thiers, mrime and augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. moreover the type of mind illustrated by mrime and meilhac and halvy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. this abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. mme. de guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. the duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. they sat down to luncheon. do you like this way of doing eggs? she asked the poet. on hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from guermantes: give monsieur some more eggs, she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the duchess, the poet and he himself left paris. but the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided mme. de guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither duke nor duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. and presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. this reserve was simply a matter of good form. but for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without  whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness  the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. it must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the duchess, was by no means constant with her. mme. de guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. it had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from victor hugo or lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending. if, in the drawing-room of mme. de villeparisis, just as in the church at combray, on the day of mlle. percepieds wedding, i had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of mme. de guermantes the unknown element of her name, i at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. but in order that i should not be disappointed by the words which i should hear uttered by a person who called herself mme. de guermantes, even if i had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which i had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. of course i had already heard mme. de villeparisis, saint-loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. but this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which i myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: the duchesse de guermantes, as though it were a name that was just like other names. and then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. for when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that i knew that i imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like bergotte that i peopled this group. no, by intelligence i understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which i understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), mme. de guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life. i thought i should find basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day, said mme. de guermantes to her aunt. i havent set eyes on your husband for some days, replied mme. de villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. in fact, i havent seen him. well, i have seen him once, perhaps  since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the queen of sweden. mme. de guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil, we met her at dinner last night at blanche lerois. you wouldnt know her now, shes positively enormous; im sure she must have something the matter with her. i was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog, mme. de guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment. i dont remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now shes the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. or rather, it isnt quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, shes more like a frog in an interesting condition. ah, that is quite clever, said mme. de villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her nieces wit. it is purely arbitrary, though, answered mme. de guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as swann would have done, for i must admit i never saw a frog in the family way. anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for i never saw her so skittish as shes been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. i promised id let you know in good time. mme. de villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: i know she was dining with the mecklenburgs the night before last. hannibal de braut was there. he came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, i must say. there was a man there whos a great deal wittier than babal, said mme. de guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih m. de brut-consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. i mean m. bergotte. i had never imagined that bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, i thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which i had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the duchess smile, m. de braut was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the faubourg saint-germain. i was stupefied to see the balance upset, and bergotte rise above m. de braut. but above all i was dismayed to think that i had avoided bergotte on the evening of phdre, that i had not gone up and spoken to him, when i heard mme. de guermantes say to mme. de villeparisis: he is the only person i have any wish to know, went on the duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. it would be such a pleasure. the presence of bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which i had thought liable to give mme. de guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon. i gather that he didnt behave very well, he was presented to m. de cobourg, and never uttered a word to him, said mme. de guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. he never once said monseigneur to him, she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a protestant, during an audience with the pope, to go on his knees before his holiness. interested by these idiosyncrasies of bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. despite this unusual mode of appreciating bergottes originality, it was a fact which i was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that mme. de guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider bergotte more witty than m. de braut. thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. and they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards. the comte dargencourt, charg daffaires at the belgian legation and a remote connexion of mme. de villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the baron de guermantes and h. h. the due de chtellerault, whom mme. de guermantes greeted with: how dye do, young chtellerault, in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young dukes mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. the historian of the fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayors office and not knowing what to do with his hat. feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them: no, no, he said, dont leave them on the floor, theyll be trodden on. a glance from the baron de guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian. what is that persons name? i was asked by the baron, who had just been introduced to me by mme. de villeparisis. m. pierre, i whispered. pierre what? pierre: its his name, hes a historian, a most distinguished man. really? you dont say so. no, its a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor, mme. de villeparisis explained. im like you, i can never get used to it. still, its better than my nephew robert, who always leaves his in the hall. i tell him when i see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and i ask him if hes come to wind the clocks. you were speaking just now, madame la marquise, of m. moles hat; we shall soon be able, like aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats, said the historian of the fronde, somewhat reassured by mme. de villeparisiss intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him. she really is astonishing, the little duchess, said m. dargencourt, pointing to mme. de guermantes who was talking to g. whenever theres a famous man in the room youre sure to find him sitting with her. evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. it cant always be m. de borelli, of course, or m. schlumberger or m. davenel. but then its bound to be m. pierre loti or m. edmond rostand. yesterday evening at the doudeauvilles, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had m. deschanel on one side and the german ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about china; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldnt hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasnt going to be war. really, youd have said she was a queen, holding her circle. everyone had gathered round mme. de villeparisis to watch her painting. those flowers are a truly celestial pink, said legrandin, i should say sky-pink. for there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. but, he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the marquise, i think i shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. you leave pisanello and van huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals. an artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them. what makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we dont have now, but they did it with great skill. ah! the flowers of their period! that is a most ingenious theory, exclaimed legrandin. i see youre painting some fine cherry blossoms  or are they may-flowers? began the historian of the fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats. no; theyre apple blossom, said the duchesse de guermantes, addressing her aunt. ah! i see youre a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another. why yes, so they are! but i thought the season for apple blossom was over now, said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake. oh dear, no; far from it, its not out yet; the trees wont be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps, said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of mme. de villeparisiss estates, was better informed upon country matters. at least three weeks, put in the duchess; even round paris, where theyre very far forward. down in normandy, dont you know, at his fathers place, she went on, pointing to the young duc de chtellerault, where they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a japanese screen, theyre never really pink until after the twentieth of may. i never see them, said the young duke, because they give me hay fever. such a bore. hay fever? i never heard of that before, said the historian. its the fashionable complaint just now, the librarian informed him. that all depends, you wont get it at all, probably, if its a good year for apples. you know le normands saying: when its a good year for apples    , put in m. dargencourt who, not being really french, was always trying to give himself a parisian air. youre quite right, mme. de villeparisis told her niece, these are from the south. it was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. youre surprised, i dare say, monsieur valmre, she turned to the librarian, that a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. well, i may be an old woman, but im not quite on the shelf yet, i have still a few friends, she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, i could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles. bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which mme. de villeparisis was painting. never mind, marquise, said the historian, sitting down again, even though we should have another of those revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood  and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell, he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no disaffected person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, with a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right. the historian of the fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. but he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old mans. bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet. really, you have the fingers of a fairy, went on (to the marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed blochs clumsiness. but bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: its not of the slightest importance; im not wet. mme. de villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. she invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also mme. de guermantes, with the injunction: remember to tell gisle and berthe (the duchesses dauberjon and de portefin) to be here a little before two to help me, as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables. she treated her princely relatives, as she treated m. de norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, cottard, bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. this was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister  who needed and received tactful handling  of their father or uncle. there would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. but, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. she could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five oclock tea-parties as, later on, in her memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. and the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the cottards, of the blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for mme. de villeparisis  failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her  the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the duchesse de guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. bloch got up to go. he had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: if people cant train their servants to put flowers where they wont be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, its much better not to go in for such luxuries, he muttered angrily. he was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. in a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. he had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. fortunately in another minute mme. de villeparisis was to press him to stay. either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. he, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. but mme. de villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting m. de norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the marquises drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in europe thronged. he had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress with pure eyes, fair as hera, who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. but on hearing this ladys name mme. de villeparisis had declined, for it was that of saint-loups mistress. i have better news, she murmured in my ear. i really believe hes quite cooled off now, and that before very long theyll be parted  in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business, she added. for roberts family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on m. de borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdressers instance, to go to bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. its really too bad of him, said mme. de villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the guermantes, even the most depraved. too, too bad, she repeated, giving the word a trio of ts. one felt that she had no doubt of the princes being present at all their orgies. but, as kindness of heart was the old ladys dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: the prince de borodino! speaking as a woman for whom the empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us. i have a great admiration for de saint-loup-en-bray, said bloch, dirty dog as he is, because hes so extremely well-bred. i have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, theyre so rare, he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. i will give you an example which i consider most striking of his perfect breeding. i met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. he introduced us, but i did not catch the gentlemans name; one never does catch peoples names when ones introduced to them, he explained with a laugh, this being one of his fathers witticisms. de saint-loup-en-bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. well, i found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of sir rufus israels! the end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. the fact was that sir rufus israels, who seemed to bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom saint-loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it. i learned this, bloch informed us, from the person who holds sir rufuss power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. oh, an absolutely wonderful individual, he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself. tell me, bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, how much do you suppose saint-loup has? not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, dont you. im interested from the balzacian point of view. you dont happen to know what its in, french stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what? i could give him no information whatsoever. suddenly raising his voice, bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. mme. de villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. of course, if its bad for you! bloch was downcast. but you cant say its not hot in here. and breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against mme. de villeparisis. he received none, from these well-bred people. his blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: whats the temperature? seventy-two, at least, i should say. im not surprised. im simply dripping. and i have not, like the sage antenor, son of the river aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils. and with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: well, if you believe its good for you! i must say, i think youre quite wrong. its exactly what gives you your cold. bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting m. de norpois. he would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the dreyfus case. theres a mentality at work there which i dont altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat, he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the ambassador. mme. de villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. she was more shocked to hear bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: havent i read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the japanese war was bound to end in a russian victory and a japanese defeat? hes fairly paralytic now, isnt he? im sure hes the old boy ive seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels. oh, dear, no! not in the least like that! just wait a minute, the marquise went on, i dont know what he can be doing. she rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: go and tell m. de norpois to come in she ordered him, he is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and ive been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. he will tell you about the dreyfus case, anything you want to know, she said gruffly to bloch. he doesnt approve much of the way things are going. for m. de norpois was not on good terms with the government of the day, and mme. de villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask m. de norpois to introduce them to mme. de villeparisis. but several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. one knew the address. one went to the house. one did not see its mistress. but at dinner that evening she would say: i hear theyve been down here bothering you. i trust things are going better. you are not in a hurry? she now asked bloch. no, not at all. i wanted to go because i am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at vichy for my biliary ducts, he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony. why, thats where my nephew chtelleraults got to go, you must fix it up together. is he still in the room? hes a nice boy, you know, said mme. de villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other. oh, i dare say he wouldnt care about that  i dont really know him  at least i barely know him. he is sitting over there, stammered bloch in ecstasy of confusion. the butler could not have delivered his mistresss message properly, for m. de norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss mme. de villeparisiss hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. he was not aware that the marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking m. de norpois and bloch into an adjoining room. bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be m. de norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: who is that old idiot? perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by m. de norpois had really shocked the better element in blochs nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. however that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed. monsieur lambassadeur, said mme. de villeparisis, i should like you to know this gentleman. monsieur bloch, monsieur le marquis de norpois. she made a point, despite her casual usage of m. de norpois, of addressing him always as monsieur lambassadeur, as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his ambassadorial rank, a respect which the marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man  which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover. m. de norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name bloch, and murmured: i am delighted     whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: not at all! on the contrary, it is i who am delighted. but this ceremony, which m. de norpois, in his friendship for mme. de villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of bloch, to whom she said: just ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if its more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. i think you wished to speak to him about the dreyfus case, she went on, no more considering whether this would suit m. de norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the duchesse de montmorencys portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup. you must speak loud, she warned bloch, hes a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew bismarck very well, and cavour. that is so, isnt it; she raised her voice, you knew bismarck well? have you got anything on the stocks? m. de norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. i took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for i saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. you shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. i gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. are you thinking of letting us have anything else? you were greatly smitten with bergotte, if i remember rightly. youre not to say anything against bergotte, put in the duchess. i dont dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, duchess. he understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like m. cherbuliez. but it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelists business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. i shall be seeing your father on sunday at our good friend a. j.s, he went on, turning again to myself. i had hoped for a moment, when i saw him talking to mme. de guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to mme. swanns. another of my great favourites, i told him, is elstir. it seems the duchesse de guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable bunch of radishes which i remember at the exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is! and indeed, if i had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture i liked best, i should have named this bunch of radishes. a masterpiece? cried m. de norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. it makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch. (he was right.) if you label a clever little thing of that sort masterpiece, what have you got to say about hberts virgin or dagnan-bouveret? i heard you refusing to let him bring roberts woman, said mme. de guermantes to her aunt, after bloch had taken the ambassador aside. i dont think youll miss much, shes a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides shes grotesquely ugly. do you mean to say, you know her, duchess? asked m. dargencourt. yes, didnt you know that she performed in my house before the whole of paris, not that thats anything for me to be proud of, explained mme. de guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. hallo, i suppose i ought to be going now, she added, without moving. she had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze  dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun  of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the bulls which the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies skirts and interrupting conversations. a permanent smile  suggesting a good king of yvetot slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a sharks fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: how do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, monsieur bloch; how do, argencourt; and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: how do, my young neighbour, hows your father? what a splendid fellow he is! he made no great demonstration except to mme. de villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron. being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latters self-sufficiency. one could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a greek gods. do you mean to tell me she performed in your house? m. dargencourt asked the duchess. well, dont you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress. mme. de guermantes shared her aunts affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her rs like mme. de villeparisis. before m. de norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, i went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my fathers academic chair. he tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. i pointed out that i was going to balbec. what? going again to balbec? why, youre a regular globe-trotter. he listened to what i had to say. at the name of leroy-beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. i conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to m. leroy-beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economists having repeated it to him. all at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. and after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: no, no, he said to me with emotion, your father must not stand. in his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. he is too big a man for that. if he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. he is not an orator, thank heaven. and that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of academe. besides, he would not get many votes. the academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. for the present, there is nothing to be done. later on, i dont say. but he must wait until the society itself comes in quest of him. it makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far da s of our friends across the alps. leroy-beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way i did not at all like. i pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as bismarck used to say. but, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, principis obsta. his friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. indeed, he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, i am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. well, simply because i am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables arcades ambo), simply because i know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, i should not vote for him. i fancy, moreover, that i have given him to understand that i should not. (i seemed to discern in his eyes the stern assyrian profile of leroy-beaulieu.) so that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part. m. de norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther academicians as old fossils. other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: ah! if it only rested with me! than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. i may tell you, he concluded, that in the best interests of you all, i should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years time. words which i assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on i was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning. you havent thought of giving the institute an address on the price of bread during the fronde, i suppose, the historian of that movement timidly inquired of m. de norpois. you could make a considerable success of a subject like that, (which was to say, you would give me a colossal advertisement,) he added, smiling at the ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. i seemed to have seen this look before, and yet i had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. suddenly i remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which i suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. when, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, i had told him that i knew professor cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in cotterds interest: now this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the academy of medicine! he had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the fronde. obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. and the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. i did not hear the ambassadors reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round mme. de villeparisis to watch her at work. you know who were talking about, basin? the duchess asked her husband. i can make a pretty good guess, said the duke. ah! as an actress shes not, im afraid, in what one would call the great tradition. you cant imagine, went on mme. de guermantes to m. dargencourt anything more ridiculous. in fact, it was drolatic, put in m. de guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile. what i fail to understand, resumed the duchess, is how in the world robert ever came to fall in love with her. oh, of course i know one mustnt discuss that sort of thing, she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. i know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. and, she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, that is the really nice thing about love, because its what makes it so mysterious. mysterious! oh, i must confess, cousin, thats a bit beyond me, said the comte dargencourt. oh dear, yes, its a very mysterious thing, love, declared the duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the club that there is something more than just noise in the walkre. after all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think, she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. after all, one never knows anything, does one? she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. besides, one understands, doesnt one; one simply cant explain other peoples choices in love. but having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise saint-loups choice. all the same, dont you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person whos simply silly. bloch, hearing saint-loups name mentioned and gathering that he was in paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. he was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented la boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. he went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his la poulie friends. in the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. in this way bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. what harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the right thing, a la boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a saint, such as bloch himself? i say, though, what about swann? objected m. dargencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousins speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction. oh, but swanns case was quite different, the duchess protested. it was a great surprise, i admit, because shes just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking. oh, oh! muttered mme. de villeparisis. you never thought so? surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. nowadays, i quite agree, shes horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. not that that made me any less sorry when charles married her, because it was so unnecessary. the duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as m. dargencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words  either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh  and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. she went on: yes, really, it wasnt worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and i can quite understand anybodys falling in love with her, but if you saw roberts girl, i assure you, youd simply die of laughter. oh, i know somebodys going to quote augier at me: what matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk? well, robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasnt shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! first of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. oh, a mere nothing  what?  and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. and then, if youd heard the things she recited, i only remember one scene, but im sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the seven princesses. seven princesses! dear, dear, what a snob she must be! cried m. dargencourt. but, wait a minute, why, i know the whole play. the author sent a copy to the king, who couldnt understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him. it isnt by any chance, from the sar peladan? asked the historian of the fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed. so you know the seven princesses, do you? replied the duchess, i congratulate you! i only know one, but shes quite enough; i have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. if they are all like the one ive seen! what a goose! i thought to myself. irritated by the coldness of her greeting, i found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand maeterlinck. to think thats the woman i walk miles every morning to see. really, im too kind. well, its my turn now not to want to see her. thus i reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger. i cant tell you what it was like, the duchess went on; you simply couldnt help laughing. not that anyone tried; rather the other way, im sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and robert has never really forgiven me. though i cant say im sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and i dont quite see marie-aynard approving of that. this was the name given in the family to roberts mother, mme. de marsantes, the widow of aynard de saint-loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the princesse de guermantes-bavire, also a marie, to whose christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her marie-gilbert or marie-hedwige. to begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair! went on mme. de guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. just imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didnt open her mouth  im not exaggerating  for a good five minutes. oh, i say, cried m. dargencourt. with the utmost politeness i took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. and she said  i give you her actual words one ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself. when you think of it, that really is monumental. but i understood she wasnt at all bad at reciting poetry, said one of the two young men. she hasnt the ghost of a notion what poetry is, replied mme. de guermantes. however, i didnt need to listen to her to tell that. it was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. i knew at once that she couldnt have any talent when i saw those lilies! everybody laughed. i hope, my dear aunt, you arent angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the queen of sweden. ive come to ask your forgiveness. oh, no, im not at all angry, i even give you leave to eat at my table, if youre hungry.  come along, m. valmre, youre the daughter of the house, mme. de villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry. m de guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him. this gentleman makes you an admirable daughter, commented m. dargencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep mme. de villeparisiss little joke in circulation. the librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the fronde. you perform your functions admirably, said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. at the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him. tell me, my dear aunt, m. de guermantes inquired of mme. de villeparisis, who was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as i came in? i must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but i couldnt place him at all; you know i never can remember names, its such a nuisance, he added, in a tone of satisfaction. m. legrandin. oh, but oriane has a cousin whose mother, if im not mistaken, was a grandin. yes, i remember quite well, she was a grandin de lepervier. no, replied mme. de villeparisis, no relation at all. these are plain grandins. grandins of nothing at all. but theyd be only too glad to be grandins of anything you chose to name. this one has a sister called mme. de cambremer. why, basin, you know quite well who my aunt means, cried the duchess indignantly. hes the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. she stayed a solid hour; i thought i should go mad. but i began by thinking it was she who was mad when i saw a person i didnt know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow. listen, oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; i couldnt very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, shes not in the least like a cow, he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience. he knew that his wifes lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process mme. de guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. and the duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player. i admit she doesnt look like a cow, she looks like a dozen, exclaimed mme. de guermantes. i assure you, i didnt know what to do when i saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how i was. i had half a mind to say: please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you cant possibly know me, because youre a herd of cattle, but after racking my brains over her i came to the conclusion that your cambremer woman must be the infanta dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that i was just on the point of saying: your royal highness and using the third person to a herd of cattle. the cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the queen of sweden. but this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. for i dont know how long before, i was bombarded with her cards; i used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. i couldnt think what they were supposed to be advertising. you saw nothing in the house but marquis et marquise de cambremer with some address or other which ive forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there. but its a great distinction to look like a queen, said the historian of the fronde. gad, sir, kings and queens, in these days, dont amount to much, said m. de guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly. bloch and m. de norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us. well, sir, asked mme. de villeparisis, have you been talking to him about the dreyfus case? m. de norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his dulcinea compelled him to submit. nevertheless he spoke to bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which france was passing. as this presumably meant that m. de norpois (to whom bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of dreyfus) was an ardent anti-dreyfusard, the ambassadors geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the government, flattered blochs vanity and aroused his curiosity. what were the important points which m. de norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and m. de norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, mme. de villeparisis having spoken at some length to m. de norpois of blochs literary work. you are not of your age, the former ambassador told him, and i congratulate you upon that. you are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a government. bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. but here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which m. de norpois referred. bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. he returned to the dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating m. de norpoiss own views. he tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. bloch had been able, thanks to a nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the zola trial. he would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the days proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. the human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. to blochs questions m. de norpois replied: there are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom i remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment i felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly  i mean m. de miribel. they are lieutenant-colonel henry and lieutenant-colonel picquart. but, exclaimed bloch, the divine athena, daughter of zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. and they are fighting against one another like two lions. colonel picquart had a splendid position in the army, but his moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. the sword of the nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men. m. de norpois made no reply. what are those two palavering about over there? m. de guermantes asked mme. de villeparisis, indicating m. de norpois and bloch. the dreyfus case. the devil they are. by the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of dreyfus? i give you a thousand guesses. my nephew robert! i can tell you that, at the jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. and as hes coming up for election next week     of course, broke in the duchess, if theyre all like gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the jews ought to be sent back to jerusalem. indeed; then the prince de guermantes is quite of my way of thinking, put in m. dargencourt. the duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable. what makes you think we want to hear about gilbert and jerusalem? its nothing to do with that. but, he went on in a gentler tone, you will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the jockey, especially robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. what can you expect, my dear, its got em on the raw, those fellows; theyre all over it. i dont blame them, either; personally, you know that i have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and i do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of marquis de saint-loup one isnt a dreyfusard; what more can i say? m. de guermantes uttered the words: when one goes by the name of marquis de saint-loup, with some emphasis. he knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of duc de guermantes. but if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title duc de guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. for the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. and not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. under this law m. de guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: when one goes by the name of duc de guermantes, whereas an educated man, a swann, a legrandin would not have said it. a duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet aristocratic be earned by the writings of a plebeian. who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom m. de guermantes had picked up when one goes by the name, he had probably not the least idea. but another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into france a certain weed from america, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. so, just as in a certain year i heard bloch say, referring to himself, that the most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without  namely bloch, and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so i was often to hear this when one goes by the name. what can one expect, the duke went on, with the influence hes come under; its easy to understand. still it is rather comic, suggested the duchess, when you think of his mothers attitude, how she bores us to tears with her patrie franaise, morning, noon and night. yes, but theres not only his mother to be thought of, you cant humbug us like that. theres a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of master dreyfus. she has passed on her state of mind to robert. you may not have heard, duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind, said the librarian, who was secretary to the anti-revisionist committee. they say mentality. it means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what youre talking about. it is the very latest expression just now, the last word as people say. meanwhile, having heard blochs name, he was watching him question m. de norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the marquise. trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a jew more or less affiliated to the syndicate. indeed, said the duke, mentality, you say; i must make a note of that; i shall use it some day. this was no figure of speech, the duke having a little pocketbook filled with such references which he used to consult before dinner-parties. i like mentality. there are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. i read somewhere the other day that some writer was talentuous. you may perhaps know what it means; i dont. and since then ive never come across the word again. but mentality is more widely used than talentuous, the historian of the fronde made his way into the conversation. i am on a committee at the ministry of education at which i have heard it used several times, as well as at my club, the volney, and indeed at dinner at m. emile olliviers. i, who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education, replied the duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, i who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education, he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, nor to the volney club (my only clubs are the union and the jockey  you arent in the jockey, i think, sir? he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), i, who am not even invited to dine with m. emile ollivier, i must confess that i had never heard mentality. im sure youre in the same boat, argencourt. you know, he went on, why they cant produce the proofs of dreyfuss guilt. apparently its because the war ministers wife was his mistress, thats what people are saying. ah! i thought it was the prime ministers wife, said m. dargencourt. i think youre all equally tiresome about this wretched case, said the duchesse de guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. it cant make any difference to me, so far as the jews are concerned, for the simple reason that i dont know any of them, and i intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. but on the other hand i do think it perfectly intolerable that just because theyre supposed to hold sound views and dont deal with jewish tradesmen, or have down with the jews printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of durands and dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by marie-aynard or victurnienne. i went to see marie-aynard a couple of days ago. it used to be so nice there. nowadays one finds all the people one has spent ones life trying to avoid, on the pretext that theyre against dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be. no; it was the war ministers wife; at least, thats the bedside rumour, went on the duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. personally, of course, as everyone knows, i take just the opposite view to my cousin gilbert. i am not feudal like him. i would go about with a negro if he was a friend of mine, and i shouldnt care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of saint-loup one doesnt amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than voltaire or even my nephew. nor does one go in for what i may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. it is a bit stiff, really! no, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. i expect she told him that he would be classed among the intellectuals. the intellectuals, theyre the very cream of those gentry. its given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one. and the duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wifes and m. dargencourts benefit, mater semita, which had already made its way into the jockey club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke. we might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us, he went on, indicating the historian. but it is better not to repeat it, especially as theres not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. i am not so ambitious as my cousin mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before christ to the tribe of levi, and i will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of jewish blood in our family. still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephews highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at landerneau. especially as fezensac is ill just now, and duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances, concluded the duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed making nuisances to mean making difficulties. bloch tried to pin m. de norpois down on colonel picquart. there can be no two opinions; replied m. de norpois, his evidence had to be taken. i am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, i have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the government were bound to let the colonel speak. one cant dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does theres always the risk of falling into a ditch. as for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. when one saw him, looking so well in that smart chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: on my honour as a soldier (here m. de norpoiss voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) such is my conviction, it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound. there; he is a dreyfusard, theres not the least doubt of it, thought bloch. but where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, gribelin. when one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make, (here m. de norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) when one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: colonel, sir, you know very well that i have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, i am speaking the truth, the wind changed; m. picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco. no; evidently hes an anti-dreyfusard; its quite obvious, said bloch to himself. but if he considers picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. and if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with gribelin? in any case, if this man dreyfus is innocent, the duchess broke in, he hasnt done much to prove it. what idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. i dont know whether m. esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. that cant be very pleasant for the supporters of m. dreyfus. what a pity for them theres no way of exchanging innocents. everybody laughed. you heard what oriane said? the duc de guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de villeparisis. yes; i think it most amusing. this was not enough for the duke. well, i dont know, i cant say that i thought it amusing; or rather it doesnt make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. i dont care about wit. m. dargencourt protested. it is probably because ive been a member of parliament, where i have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. i learned there to value, more than anything, logic. thats probably why they didnt elect me again. amusing things leave me cold. basin, dont play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do. please let me finish. it is just because i am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that i am often struck by my wifes wit. for you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. she reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer. possibly the explanation of m. de norpoiss speaking in this way to bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-dreyfusard that, finding the government not anti-dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the dreyfusards. perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. but where bloch made a mistake was in thinking that m. de norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by henry, picquart or du paty de clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. the truth, indeed, as to all these matters bloch could not doubt that m. de norpois knew. how could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the ministers? naturally, bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the president of the republic and the prime minister, who imparted it to their cabinet. now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patients disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctors reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. so, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as henrys confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the dreyfusard ministers, and by cavaignac and cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the dreyfusard ministers themselves, men of the same shade of dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du paty de clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter reinach. all that bloch could elicit from m. de norpois was that if it were true that the chief of staff, m. de boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to m. rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred. you may be quite sure that the war minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his chief of staff to the infernal powers. an official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. but the war minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. there are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards. but those documents are obviously forged, put in bloch. m. de norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by prince henri dorlans. besides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. heaven be praised, france is not a south american republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento. bioch could not get him to speak on the question of dreyfuss guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. on the other hand, m. de norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment. if it is a conviction, he said, it will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. to return to prince henris outburst, i greatly doubt whether it has met with his fathers approval. you think chartres is for dreyfus? asked the duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised. not at all; i meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable princesse clmentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, prince ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. you would never have found the prince of bulgaria clasping major esterhazy to his bosom. he would have preferred a private soldier, murmured mme. de guermantes, who often met the bulgarian monarch at dinner at the prince de joinvilles, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: yes, sir, of your bracelets. you arent going to mme. de sagans ball this evening? m. de norpois asked mme. de villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with bloch. my friend had not failed to interest the ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in blochs speech of the neo-homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: he is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. you expect him to come out with the learned sisters, like lamartine or jean-baptiste rousseau. it has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. we ourselves were inclined to be romantic. but however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, m. de norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough. no, sir, i dont go to balls any more, she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. youre going, all of you, i suppose? youre the right age for that sort of thing, she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance m. de chtellerault, his friend and bloch. still, i was asked, she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. in fact, they came specially to ask me. (they being the princesse de sagan.) i havent had a card, said bloch, thinking that mme. de villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that mme. de sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite. the marquise made no reply, and bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the rue royale club, which was letting in every tom, dick and harry, he wished to ask mme. de villeparisis to arrange for his election there. arent they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these sagans? he inquired in a tone of sarcasm. not at all, theyre the best we can do for you in that line, m. dargencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of parisian society, assured him. then, said bloch, still half in irony, i suppose its one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season. mme. de villeparisis turned merrily to mme. de guermantes. tell us, is it a great social solemnity, mme. de sagans ball? its no good asking me, answered the duchess, i have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. besides, society isnt my strong point. indeed; i thought it was just the other way, said bloch, who supposed mme. de guermantes to be speaking seriously. he continued, to the desperation of m. de norpois, to ply him with questions about the dreyfus case. the ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du paty de clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry. i know that the socialist party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the devils isle. but i think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the caudine forks of mm. grault-richard and company. so far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, i dont say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. that certain of your clients more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions i will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things, he added, with a look of great subtlety. it is essential that the government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the army. it stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. and what follows from that? obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. when the day comes, the government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. we must appoint judges to try dreyfus. and that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet france, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words truth and justice, it is necessary to cross the channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the spree, there are judges to be found outside berlin. but once the machinery of government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? when it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? when its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: present!? m. de norpois put these questions to bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. should you fail to disarm, m. de norpois went on, without waiting for blochs collective answer, should you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, i say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? have you given them pledges? bloch was in doubt how to answer. m. de norpois gave him no time. if the negative be true, as i should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the criminal court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. i do not guarantee that the whole of the general staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire. it stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list  already too long  of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece, he added, looking bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemys camp. government action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. the government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of colonel driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under m. clemenceaus. we must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. france, the vast majority here in france, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. as to that, there can be no question whatever. but we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. and the government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, i mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. the government will accept all your suggestions. if it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom. you, sir, said bloch, turning to m. dargencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentlemans arrival, you are a dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad. it is a question that concerns only the french themselves, dont you think? replied m. dargencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite. bloch coloured; m. dargencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at blochs expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. mme. de guermantes murmured something to m. dargencourt which i could not hear, but which must have referred to blochs religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the duchess that expression to which ones fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. to retrieve himself, bloch turned to the duc de chtellerault. you, sir, as a frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. anyhow, i know  can talk freely to you; saint-loup told me so. but the young duke, who felt that every one was turning against bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from m. de charlus, replied: you must not ask me, sir, to discuss the dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, i never mention except to japhetics. everyone smiled, except bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near sinai. but instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to blochs lips something quite different. and we caught only: but how on earth did you know? who told you? as though he had been the son of a convict. whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind. what m. de norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether mme. de villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house m. du paty de clam or m. joseph reinach. the librarian made no reply; he was a nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. he asked himself whether bloch might not be a secret emissary of the syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to mme. de villeparisis the questions that bloch had put to him. she decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise m. de norpois. also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her m. judets article in the petit journal). she decided, therefore, to make it plain to bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. as bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. blochs farewell, barely pencilling on the marquises face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. this scene left bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. mme. de villeparisis was startled. but doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes. i believe shes asleep, said bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the marquise, assumed an indignant air. good-bye madame, snouted bloch. the old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to m. dargencourt, while bloch left the room, convinced that she must be soft in the head. full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. she received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth. you were speaking just now of the seven princesses, duchess; you know (not that its anything to be proud of) that the author of that  what shall i call it?  that production is a compatriot of mine, said m. dargencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. yes, hes a belgian, by nationality, he went on. indeed! no, we dont accuse you of any responsibility for the seven princesses. fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. i know several charming belgians, yourself, your king, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, i am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the seven princesses. besides, if you want to know, its not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. you know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. if there was anything behind it all, i may tell you that im not in the least afraid of a little daring, she added in a serious tone, provided that there is some idea in it. i dont know if youve seen borellis piece. some people seem to have been shocked by it, but i must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it, she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, i found it immensely interesting. but theseven princesses! its all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, i cannot carry family feeling quite     the duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the comtesse de marsantes, roberts mother. mme. de marsantes was regarded in the faubourg saint-germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. so i had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the duc de guermantes. later, i have always been taken aback, whenever i have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de guermantes and mme. de marsantes, ought (i felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard. mme. de marsantes attended brunetires lectures. she fascinated the faubourg saint-germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. but the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify mme. de marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the duke. i could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyones sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. it seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and i was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. mme. de marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. this was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, m. de montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. she was a great lady. atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. mme. de marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. she was more than pleasant to me, both because i was roberts friend and because i did not move in the same world as he. this pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. a good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. mme. de marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance bergotte or elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the guermantes: i have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting monsieur bergotte, or of making the acquaintance of monsieur elstir whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that mme. de guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently honoured. whichever of these was the true reason, one felt that when mme. de marsantes said: i have had the honour, the great hon-our, she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. on the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity. in the country, mme. de marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of france had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call manners, and had given her a perfect simplicity. she never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. she was, people said, the perfect christian. she was determined to find an immensely rich wife for robert. being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. it is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. some one said to me afterwards, when i had told him of my meeting her: you saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman. but true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. i said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression. listen, said mme. de villeparisis to the duchesse de guermantes, im expecting a woman at any moment whom you dont wish to know. i thought id better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. but you neednt be afraid, i shall never have her here again, only i was obliged to let her come to-day. its swanns wife. mme. swann, seeing the dimensions that the dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husbands racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoners innocence. when he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of mme. verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. mme. swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the womens leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. it may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the duchesse de guermantes, so close a friend of swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. but we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the duchess, who held that she was not bound to do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social free will, which was extremely arbitrary. thank you for telling me, said the duchess. it would indeed be most unpleasant. but as i know her by sight i shall be able to get away in time. i assure you, oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman, said mme. de marsantes. i have no doubt she is, but i feel no need to assure myself of it. have you been invited to lady israelss? mme. de villeparisis asked the duchess, to change the conversation. why, thank heaven, i dont know the woman, replied mme. de guermantes. you must ask marie-aynard. she knows her. i never could make out why. i did indeed know her at one time, said mme. de marsantes. i confess my faults. but i have decided not to know her any more. it seems shes one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. i shall never go near anyone of that race again. while we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to jews. and now we see what thanks we get from them. but ive no right to speak; i have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine, she went on, having caught some allusion by m. dargencourt to robert. but, talking of robert, havent you seen him? she asked mme. de villeparisis; being saturday, i thought hed be coming to paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit. as a matter of fact mme. de marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see mme. de villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her. robert here! but i have never had a single word from him; i dont think ive seen him since balbec. he is so busy; he has so much to do, pleaded mme. de marsantes. a faint smile made mme. de guermantess eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. whenever the duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, mme. de marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-laws behalf. the latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by roberts pranks. at this point the door opened again and robert himself entered the room. well, talk of the saint! said mme. de guermantes. mme. de marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. when she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on robert eyes big astonishment. what! youve come! how delightful! what a surprise! ah! talk of the saint!  i see, cried the belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter. delicious, aint it? came tartly from the duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself. good afternoon, robert, she said, i believe hes forgotten his aunt. they talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as saint-loup was leaving her to join his mother mme. de guermantes turned to me: good afternoon; how are you? was her greeting. she allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. thus she acted under the fire of saint-loups eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me: hes not very well just now, he gets rather tired; i think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for i cant help telling you that he admires you immensely. oh, but thats very nice of him, said mme. de guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if i had brought her her cloak. i am most flattered. look, i must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair, said saint-loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt. we were both silent. i see you sometimes in the morning, she said, as though she were telling me something that i did not know, and i for my part had never seen her. its so good for one, a walk. oriane, began mme. de marsantes in a low tone, you said you were going on to mme. de saint-ferrols; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, i shall stay at home now that ive got robert. and one other thing, but i hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars robert likes. corona, theyre called. ive none in the house. robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of mme. de saint-ferrol. who in the world is mme. de saint-ferrol? he inquired, in a sur  prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society. but, my dear boy, you know quite well, said his mother. shes vermandoiss sister. it was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much. what, shes vermandoiss sister, i had no idea of that. really, my family are amazing, he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously blochs intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, they know the most unheard-of people, people called saint-ferrol (emphasising the final consonant of each word) and names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. its prodigious. mme. de guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephews wit. a servant came in to say that the prince von faffenheim-munsterburg-weinigen had sent word to m. de norpois that he was waiting. bring him in, sir, said mme. de villeparisis to the old ambassador, who started in quest of the german minister. stop, sir; do you think i ought to shew him the miniature of the empress charlotte? why, im sure hell be delighted, said the ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate minister the favour that was in store for him. oh, i know hes very sound, said mme. de marsantes, and that is so rare among foreigners. but ive found out all about him. he is anti-semitism personified. the princes name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were  to borrow an expression from music  attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the heim of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the german eighteenth century. this name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little german watering-place to which as a child i had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which homer applies to his heroes. and so, scarcely had i heard the princes name spoken than, before i had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. and then, m. de guermantes, in explaining who the prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and i recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, i used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. and indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. thus beneath the visor of the prince of the holy roman empire and knight of franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-oclock sun, that i saw, at any rate before the prince, rheingraf and elector palatine had entered the room. for i speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient burg that cherished memories of luther and lewis the germanic, he employed in keeping five charron motor-cars, a house in paris and one in london, a box on mondays at the opera and another for the tuesdays at the franais. he did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. he had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a corresponding member of the academy of moral and political sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see mme. de villeparisis. if he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in berlin, had begged to be introduced to the marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. he knew that m. de norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. and so the prince, who had known him in russia when they were both there as ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. but in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the marquis russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. no doubt m. de norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and take the trouble to come so far out of his way, went himself to the princes residence, and when the teutonic knight had launched his: i should like immensely to be your colleague, replied in a tone of deep emotion: ah! i should be most happy! and no doubt a simpleton, a dr. cottard would have said to himself: well, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesnt offer to vote for me it is because it hasnt occurred to him. he lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that i have all the support i want, and that is why he doesnt offer me his; but i have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: very well, vote for me, will you? and he will be obliged to do it. but prince von faffenheim was no simpleton. he was what dr. cottard would have called a fine diplomat and he knew that m. de norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. the prince, in his embassies and as foreign minister, had conducted, on his countrys behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. he was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. and it was for this reason that he had arranged for m. de norpois to receive the cordon of saint andrew. but if he had had to report to his government the conversation which he had subsequently had with m. de norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: i realised that i had gone the wrong way to work. for as soon as he had returned to the subject of the institute, m. de norpois had repeated: i should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. they ought, i consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. it is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. as you know, the academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. personally, i deplore this. how often have i had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! i cannot be sure, god forgive me, that i did not even once let the word hidebound escape me, he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. you understand, prince, that i should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. so long as my colleagues ideas linger so far behind the times, i consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. but you may rest assured that if i were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if i could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, i should be the first to inform you of it. the cordon was a mistake, thought the prince; the negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. i have not yet laid my hand on the right key. this was a kind of reasoning of which m. de norpois, formed in the same school as the prince, would also have been capable. one may mock at the pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. but their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that european or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. with this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood m. de norpois and prince von faffenheim had frequently had to deal. charg daffaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, m. de norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word peace, nor by the word war that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of france, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: war. moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the thtre du gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word war or the word peace was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a kurgarten where the minister and m. de norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. by a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. and so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the institute, the prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols. and certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. for one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. often one has to come down to kept persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. what man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: dont lets talk about money, the speech must be regarded as what is called in music a silent beat and that if, later on, she declares: you are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; ive done with you, he must interpret this as: some one else has been offering me more. and yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. the apache furnishes more striking examples. but m. as norpois and the german prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word perish. but inasmuch as all this is not set forth in yellow and otherwise coloured books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his norpois. the following winter the prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected. the devil! he said to himself, i cant afford to lose any time over the institute. if i wait too long, i may be dead before they elect me. that really would be unpleasant. he composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the revue des deux mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to m. de norpois. the french diplomat called upon him to thank him. he added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. the prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: still not the right one! and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed m. de norpois to the door, thought: damn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. we must hurry up. that evening, he met m. de norpois again at the opera. my dear ambassador, he began to him, you told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but i am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word. m. de norpois had no less high an esteem for the princes tact than the prince had for his. he understood at once that it was not a request that prince von faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it. well now, you will think me highly indiscreet. there are two people to whom i am greatly attached  in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment  two people both of whom have recently settled in paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the grand duchess john. they are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the king and queen of england, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. i confess that i did not know how i was going to gratify their wish when i learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. i know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people happy few, as stendhal would say  but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, i am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the grand duchess and the princess. perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the queen of england comes, and then (one never knows) if we dont bore her too much, to spend the easter holidays with us at beaulieu, at the grand duchess johns. the person i allude to is called the marquise de villeparisis. i confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the institute. for in her house, too, i understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk. with an inexpressible sense of pleasure the prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning. such an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear prince, replied m. de norpois; nothing is more in harmony with the institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of academicians. i shall convey your request to mme. la marquise de villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. as for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. but i shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. you must on no account give up the academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, i shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at leroy-beaulieus, without whom nobody can be elected; i had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. he raised certain objections. but it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and i fully intend to return to the charge; i shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, i shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, i should ask all my friends to vote for you, (here the prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) and he knows that i have friends. i consider that if i were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. come that evening, at six, to mme. de villeparisiss; i will introduce you to her and i can give you an account then of my conversation with him. thus it was that prince von faffenheim had been led to call upon mme. de villeparisis. my profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. it had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of minerva, leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from marivaux or samuel bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. in the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which i had expected, before i saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of mme. de villeparisis, the rheingraf said to her: aow to you too, matame la marquise, in the accent of an alsatian porter. wont you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good? mme. de guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. i do the honours in this house just as if it was mine, she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh. sir, said mme. de villeparisis to m. de norpois, you wont forget that you have something to say to the prince about the academy? mme. de guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time. gracious! i must fly at once if im to get to mme. de saint-ferrols, and im dining with mme. leroi. and she rose without bidding me good-bye. she had just caught sight of mme. swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. she remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of dreyfuss innocence. i dont want my mother to introduce me to mme. swann, saint-loup said to me. shes an ex-whore. her husbands a jew, and she comes here to pose as a nationalist. hallo, heres uncle palamde. the arrival of mme. swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which i am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. well, a few days before this visit to mme. de villeparisis, i had myself received a visitor whom i little expected, namely charles morel, the son (though i had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncles old servant. this great-uncle (he in whose house i had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. his servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; i had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for i had learned from franoise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncles memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. but, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. i was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentlemans servant. he made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the conservatoire. the object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. these were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. while young morel was shewing them to me, i noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. he derived from saying you to me as often, and sir as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: to my best friend. one actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: to the best of friends, which enabled her (so i was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. in vain might young morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. while i was turning over the photographs charles morel examined my room. and as i was looking for some place in which i might keep them, how is it, he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), that i dont see a single photograph of your uncle in your room? i felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: why, i dont believe i have such a thing. what, you havent one photograph of your uncle adolphe, who was so devoted to you! i will send you one of my governors  he has quantities of them  and i hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle. it is true that, as i had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle adolphe. but it was easy enough to see that for old morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. i was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that i was going to turn out a sort of racine, or vaulabelle, and morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. i soon discovered that this young man was extremely pushing. thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether i knew any poet who had a good position in society. i mentioned one. he did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. well, i found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the comtesse so-and-sos. this was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. the poet, taking offence, made no reply. for the rest, charles morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. he had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, jupiens niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, i felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. he had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, but not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, i rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople. albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,dear friend, i might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as not dear master, of course,.. although    well, if you like, dear distinguished artist, once in the shop, i avoided qualifying him, as saint-simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his you. he picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. the girl settled down to work again with her two apprentices, but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that charles morel, whom she regarded as of her own station (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. as i had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of miss sacripant (otherwise odette) by elstir, i said to charles morel as i went with him to the outer gate: i dont suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? i dont see at what stage in his life i can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of m. swann     why, if i wasnt forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that ladys picture. as a matter of fact, she was lunching with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. my father was in two minds whether to let you in. it seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. but just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again. he broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at jupiens niece. she was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. i, as i gave him my hand, was thinking of mme. swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that i should have henceforth to identify her with the lady in pink. m. de charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of mme. swann. at every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the barons frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. this partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for m. de charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. for instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. and then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, m. de charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. certainly mme. swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. but he professed admiration for her, friendship for swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room. mme. de villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from m. de charlus. he, while admitting serious defects in his aunts character, was genuinely fond of her. but every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. among other examples i may instance the following, which my stay at balbec brought to my knowledge-mme. de villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from m. de charlus. a month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. he received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. meeting his aunt a few days later in paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. but there was no mistake, replied mme. de villeparisis, the money order cost six francs seventy-five. oh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right, said m. de charlus, i mentioned it only in case you didnt know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didnt know you as well as i do, it might have led to unpleasantness. no, no, there was no mistake. after all, you were quite right, m. de charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunts hand. and in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. but some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had worked up a regular conspiracy against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. i shall not be satisfied with having my revenge, he added as a postscript; i shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. tomorrow i shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand i lent you; i shall disgrace you publicly. instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. but apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. but already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. he had repeated the story, but without mme. de villeparisiss knowledge. with the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. this storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. this sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. of a different order were the quarrels of bloch and his friends. of a dif  ferent order again were those of m. de charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike mme. de villeparisis. in spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations. i say, my uncle and mme. swann are getting warm over there! remarked saint-loup. and look at mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. to the pure all things are pure, i suppose! i studied m. de charlus. the tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. i had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. and yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, i was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to mme. swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the barons knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the tecs to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. m. de chtellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on m. de charluss face that he had seen the young duke until he was actually standing in front of him. in this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, m. de charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to mme. swann. but as she was not certain whether i already knew mme. de marsantes and m. de charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that i might ask her to introduce me to them. i then made my way to m. de charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. as i stood before him and bowed i found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and i was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. this coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage mme. swann to melt from hers. how tired and worried you look, said mme. de marsantes to her son who had come up to greet m. de charlus. and indeed the expression in roberts eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom this bottom which hurt robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress. never mind, his mother went on, stroking his cheek, never mind; its good to see my little boy again. but this show of affection seeming to irritate robert, mme. de marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. mme. swann, finding herself alone and having realised that i was a friend of saint-loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. not having seen her for so long i did not know what to talk to her about. i was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and i asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the duc de guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital g was surmounted by a ducal coronet. i knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be. what a pleasant man m. de norpois is, i said to mme. swann, looking at the ambassador. it is true, robert de saint-loup says hes a pest, but     he is quite right, she replied. seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, i plied her with questions. for the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner. i am sure this is what m. de saint-loup meant, she began, but you must never tell him i said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and i value his esteem very highly; i am an honest injun, dont you know. the other day, charlus was dining at the princesse de guermantess; i dont know how it was, but your name was mentioned. m. de norpois seems to have told them  its all too silly for words, dont go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it  that you were a hypocritical little flatterer. i have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as m. de norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. i was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when i had asked him about mme. swann and gilberte was known to the princesse de guermantes, whom i imagined never to have heard of my existence. each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the world, from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which i used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of mme. swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances  in the present instance to the princesse de guermantes  and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. what we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. it may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. so that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by x-rays. not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. a man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: dromedary resting. later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, i was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: this is you. a few years earlier i should have been only too glad to tell mme. swann in what connexion i had fawned upon m. de norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. but i no longer felt this desire, i was no longer in love with gilberte. on the other hand i had not succeeded in identifying mme. swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. accordingly i spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment. did you see the duchesse de guermantes just now? i asked mme. swann. but since the duchess did not bow to mme. swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark. i dont know; i didnt realise her, she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from england. i was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to mme. de guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of mme. de guermantes i questioned mme de villeparisis about mme. leroi. oh, yes, i know who you mean, she replied with an affectation of contempt, the daughter of those rich timber people. ive heard that shes begun to go about quite a lot lately, but i must explain to you that i am rather old now to make new acquaintances. i have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really i do not believe mme. lerol would be any addition to what i already have. mme. de marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the marquise, presented me to the prince and, while she was still doing so, m. de norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since i had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with french society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the princes honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented. mme. de villeparisis appealed to m. de norpois, feeling it imperative that i should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing mme. leroi. am i not right, m. lambassadeur, mme. leroi is quite uninteresting, isnt she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; i was quite right not to make friends with her, wasnt i? whether from independence or because he was tired, m. de norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning. sir, went on mme. de villeparisis with a laugh, there are some absurd people in the world. would you believe that i had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young womans? i guessed at once that this was legrandin. m. de norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a voisenon or the younger crbillon. many young womens hands would be incapable of doing what i see there, said the prince, pointing to mme. de villeparisiss unfinished water-colours. and he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by fantin-latour which had recently been exhibited. they are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette, declared m. de norpois; i consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which i find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower. even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression. i claim no credit for knowing about flowers, ive lived all my life among the fields, replied mme. de villeparisis modestly. but, she added graciously, turning to the prince, if i did, when i was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, i owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, herr von schlegel. i met him at broglie, when i was staying there once with my aunt cordelia (marshal de castellanes wife, dont you know?). i remember so well m. lebrun, m. de salvandy, m. doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. i was only a little girl, i wasnt able to follow all he said. but he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the val richer, when i fell asleep on his knee. i have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which i should not have noticed otherwise. when mme. de barante published some of mme. de broglies letters, charming and affected like herself, i hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with herr von schlegel. but she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion. robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were. you have been good to me, i said, how can i thank you? can we dine together to-morrow? to-morrow? yes, if you like, but it will have to be with bloch. i met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because i had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (at least, he didnt tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but i guessed it.) but after that he was so friendly to me that i simply cant disappoint him. between ourselves, on his side at least, i can feel its a life and death friendship. nor do i consider that robert was altogether mistaken. furious detraction was often, with bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. and as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a weeks silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. and so i have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. they rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. as for being good, went on saint-loup, you say i have been to you, but i havent been good at all, my aunt tells me that its you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. she wondered whether you had anything against her. fortunately for myself, if i had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which i believed to be imminent, for balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see mme. guermantes again, to assure her that i had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. but i had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her elstirs. besides, this was not a disappointment; i had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; i knew that i did not appeal to her, that i need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that i had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, i might there and then receive, since i should not be seeing her again before i left paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which i could take with me to balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow. mme. de marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because i felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to blochs uncle, m. nissim bernard, mme. de marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at nice. in that case, he knew m. de marsantes there before our marriage, she told me. my husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature. to think that for once in his life he wasnt lying! its incredible, would have been blochs comment. all this time i should have liked to explain to mme. de marsantes that robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. but now that mme. de guermantes had left the room, i had more leisure to observe robert, and i noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. i was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder. suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which mme. de villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. i was hurrying after him when m. de charlus, who must have supposed that i was leaving the house, turned abruptly from prince von faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. i saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital g and a ducal coronet. in the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me: as i see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. but its a little complicated, he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. i am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. but i should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. i am just going. will you walk a short way with me? i shall only keep you a moment. youd better take care, sir, i warned him; you have picked up the wrong hat by mistake. do you want to stop me taking my own hat? i assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that i had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. i told him that i must say a few words to saint-loup. he is still talking to that idiot the duc de guermantes, i added. that really is charming; i shall tell my brother. oh! you think that would interest m. de charlus? (i imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called charlus also. saint-loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at balbec, but i had forgotten the details.) who has been talking to you about m. de charlus? replied the baron in an arrogant tone. go to robert. i hear, he went on, that you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. you would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt. i should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about emerson, ibsen and tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured robert to make him drink nothing but water. in the hope of bringing some balm to robert, whose pride had, i felt, been wounded, i sought to find an excuse for his mistress. i did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. but it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. and as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact. ive come to the conclusion i was wrong about that matter of the necklace, robert said to me. of course, i never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, i know very well, other people dont look at things in the same way as oneself. she had a very hard time when she was young. in her eyes, i was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence boucheron or in a lawsuit. of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when i have never thought of anything but her good. but i do see clearly, she believes that i wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and thats not true. and shes so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, i simply cant tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. how wretched she must be feeling now! in any case, whatever happens in the long run, i dont want to let her think me a cad; i shall dash off to boucherons and get the necklace. you never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that shes been in the wrong. dont you see, its the idea that she is suffering at this moment that i cant bear. what one suffers oneself one knows; thats nothing. but with her  to say to oneself that shes suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels  i think i shall go mad in a minute  id much rather never see her again than let her suffer. she can be happy without me, if she must; thats all i ask. listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; i shall run to the jewellers and then go and ask her to forgive me. but until i get down there what will she be thinking of me? if she could only know that i was on my way! what about your going down there and telling her? for all we know, that might settle the whole business. perhaps, he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, we can all three dine together in the country. but we cant tell yet. i never know how to handle her. poor child. i shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. besides, her decision may be irrevocable. robert swept me back to his mother. good-bye, he said to her. ive got to go now. i dont know when i shall get leave again. probably not for a month. i shall write as soon as i know myself. certainly robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to ones own family is the natural complement to ones ceremonial behaviour. whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. saint-loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which rachels absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons i have been describing are with theirs. and as she listened to him i saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which mme. de marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him. what, robert, youre going away? seriously? my little son! the one day ive seen anything of you! and then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added: you know, its not at all nice of you. but to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that saint-loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. and so he grew angry. its unfortunate, but, nice or not, thats how it is. and he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. but of her own accord mme. de marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him. i shall leave you here, he said to me, but youre not to keep him long, mamma, because hes got to go somewhere else in a minute. i was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to mme. de marsantes, but i preferred, by not going with robert, not to let her suppose that i was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. i should have liked to find some excuse for her sons conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. but it was she who spoke first. poor boy, she began, i am sure i must have hurt him dreadfully. you see, sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasnt many pleasures, he comes so little to paris. oh, dear, if he hadnt gone already i should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that im not vexed with him, that i think he was quite right. will you excuse me if i go and look over the staircase? i accompanied her there. robert! robert! she called. no; hes gone; we are too late. at that moment i would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. in one case saint-loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. yet i was the same man, at an interval of a few hours. we returned to the drawing-room. seeing that saint-loup was not with us, mme. de villeparisis exchanged with m. de norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: there now, theres been trouble. robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. but it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. certain of roberts friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. and yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. i have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. at this moment, roberts friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on rachels part, at this moment she will be in the promenade at the folies-bergres. shes an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx. after all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers? robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. he knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. one could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in rachel. for it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. on one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: she is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, i may as well die  and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps  but no, it can never possibly happen. and in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: you dont know her? i congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined i dont know how many men. there isnt a worse girl in paris. shes a common swindler. and cunning isnt the word! and perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: no, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; i dont say she hasnt had an adventure or two in her time, but shes not a woman one pays, shed be a damned sight too expensive if she was. with her its fifty thousand francs or nothing. well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. there were in paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom saint-loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by rachel. i blame myself for one thing only, mme. de marsantes murmured in my ear, and that was my telling him that he wasnt nice to me. he, such an adorable, unique son, theres no one else like him in the world, the only time i see him, to have told him he wasnt nice to me, i would far rather hed beaten me, because i am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasnt many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. but, sir, i mustnt keep you, since youre in a hurry. anxiously, mme. de marsantes bade me good-bye. these sentiments bore upon robert; she was sincere. but she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more. i have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. thank you! thank you! and with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. these charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business. but i am in no hurry, i replied; besides, i must wait for m. de charlus; i am going with him. mme. de villeparisis overheard these last words. they appeared to vex her. had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in mme. de villeparisis was her modesty. but this hypothesis never even entered my mind. i was delighted with mme. de guermantes, with saint-loup, with mme. de marsantes, with m. de charlus, with mme. de villeparisis; i did not stop to reflect, and i spoke light-heartedly and at random. youre going from here with my nephew palamde? she asked me. thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on mme. de villeparisis if she learned that i was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, he has asked me to go home with him, i answered blithely. i am so glad. besides, we are greater friends than you think, and ive quite made up my mind that were going to be better friends still. from being vexed, mme. de villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. dont wait for him, she said to me, with a preoccupied air. he is talking to m. de faffenheim. hes certain to have forgotten what he said to you. youd much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned. the first emotion shewn by mme. de villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. i was not, myself, in any hurry to join robert and his mistress. but mme. de villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, i bade her good-bye. next to her m. de guermantes, superb and olympian, was ponderously seated. one would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. at the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and i could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned french breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. i seemed to be looking at that statue of olympian zeus which phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. such was the power that good breeding had over m. de guermantes over the body of m. de guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. m. de guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other peoples. as i went downstairs i heard behind me a voice calling out to me: so this is how you wait for me, is it? it was m. de charlus. you dont mind if we go a little way on foot? he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. we can walk until i find a cab that suits me. you wished to speak to me about something, sir? oh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things i wished to say to you, but i am not so sure now whether i shall. as far as you are concerned, i am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. but i can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. i ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that i should have to take with you, and i have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. perhaps also to you yourself what i could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for i repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble. i protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. this summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking. that sort of politeness means nothing, he rebuked me coldly. there is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth ones while. for the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. in the heart of our tub, like diogenes, we cry out for a man. we cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. but we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. that is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. are you worth my trouble or not? i would not for anything in the world, sir, be a cause of anxiety to you, i said to him, but so far as i am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. i am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me. greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone. with the want of consideration common at your age, he told me, you are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. what you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you. as he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, m. de charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when i saw him outside the casino at balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside mme. swann, whom i supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. but m. de charlus immediately dismissed them. theyre not what i want, he explained to me, its all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction theyre going in. i hope, sir, he went on, that you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which i am going to make to you. i was struck by the similarity of his diction to swanns, closer now than at balbec. you have enough intelligence, i suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that i have recourse to you. i do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard  it was alluded to in a leading article in the times, which made a considerable impression  that the emperor of austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the comte de chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of european politics as myself he would be king of france to-day. i have often thought, sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which i have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom i would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what i am perhaps alone in possessing. i do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. and i do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances. (this was a favourite expression with m. de charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) i could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future. m. de charlus broke off to question me about bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunts drawing-room. and with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. he asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with m. de norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether m. de charlus was for or against drey, fus. it is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life, went on m. de charlus when he had finished questioning me, to include among your friends an occasional foreigner. i replied that bloch was french. indeed, said m. de charlus, i took him to be a jew. his assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that m. de charlus was more anti-dreyfusard than anyone i had met. he protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against dreyfus. but his protest took this form: i understand the newspapers to say that dreyfus has committed a crime against his country  so i understand, i pay no attention to the newspapers, i read them as i wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what i am doing. in any case, the crime is non-existent, your friends compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed judaea, but what has he to do with france? i pointed out that if there should be a war the jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. perhaps so, and i am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. if we bring over senegalese and malagasies, i hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending france, which is only natural. your dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. but we need not discuss that. perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the temple, at a circumcision, with jewish chants. he might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of saint-cyr performed scenes taken from the psalms by racine, to amuse louis xiv. you might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. for instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as david smote goliath. that would make quite an amusing farce. he might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his haggart) of a mother. that would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-european creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel. as he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, m. de charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. i reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose moliresque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, i felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research. i warned him that, anyhow, mme. bloch no longer existed, while as for m. bloch, i questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. m. de charlus seemed annoyed. that, he said, is a woman who made a great mistake in dying. as for blinding him, surely the synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the gospel. in any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports. at this point i caught sight of m. bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. he did not see us but i offered to introduce him to m. de charlus. i had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. introduce him to me! but you must have singularly little idea of social values! people do not get to know me as easily as that. in the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. at the most, if i am ever permitted to enjoy the asiatic spectacle which i suggested to you, i might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. but on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, i might go so far as to express my satisfaction. as it happened, m. bloch paid no attention to us. he was occupied in greeting mme. sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. i was surprised at this, for in the old days at combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. but dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted m. bloch to her feet. my fathers friend had found mme. sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. he had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: m. drumont has the impudence to put the revisionists in the same bag as the protestants and the jews. a delightful promiscuity! bernard, he had said with pride, on reaching home, to m. nissim bernard, you know, she has that prejudice! but m. nissim bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. saddened by the misfortunes of the jews, remembering his old friendships with christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. all this dreyfus business, went on the baron, still clasping me by the arm, has only one drawback. it destroys society (i do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of mr. and mrs. camels and camelfies and camelyards, astonishing creatures whom i find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the patrie franaise, or the anti-jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification. this frivolity in m. de charlus brought out his family likeness to the duchesse de guermantes. i remarked to him on the resemblance. as he appeared to think that i did not know her, i reminded him of the evening at the opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. he assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that i should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that m. de charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me. let us return to yourself, he said, and my plans for you. there exists among certain men, sir, a freemasonry of which i cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of europe now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. that is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. yes, sir, that is a fact you remember the story of the man who believed that he had the princess of china shut up in a bottle. it was a form of insanity. he was cured of it, but as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. there are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. a cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. the most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. i took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom i could tell you a great deal). he guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. but my cousin had nephritis also. what the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. understand that, if i do you a great service, i expect my reward from you to be no less great. it is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. i have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. i have had great sorrows, sir, of which i may tell you perhaps some day; i have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. i have young relatives who are not  i do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which i have been speaking. for all i know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life i shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. my own would gain in return. perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy i might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. but before i can tell i must see you often, very often, every day. i was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on m. de charluss part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, i felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. it was m. de charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of m. dargencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. on seeing us, m. dargencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than ones own with which mme. de guermantes had quizzed bloch, and tried to avoid us. but one would have said that m. de charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. and fearing perhaps that m. dargencourt had not recognised me, m. de charlus informed him that i was a great friend of mme. de villeparisis, of the duchesse de guermantes, of robert de saint-loup, and that he himself, charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. nevertheless i observed that m. dargencourt, albeit i had barely been introduced to him at mme. de villeparisiss, and m. de charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. he watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moments hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew. i am sorry about that, said m. de charlus. that fellow argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. i hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and i hope also that you will honour me by keeping it  as i shall  well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast. the duchesse de guermantes seems to be very clever. we were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. it appears that she is specially well informed on that subject. she is nothing of the sort, replied m. de charlus tartly. women, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what i was going to tell you. my sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of balzacs novels, when women had an influence on politics. going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. that was one of the very things i was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. the first sacrifice that you must make for me  i shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts i bestow on you  is to give up going into society. it distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. you may remind me that i was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. and then, i need not point out how invaluable i can be to you. the open sesame to the guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me i shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation. i thought i would take advantage of what m. de charlus had said about my call on mme. de villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than i had intended, and i asked him instead what the villeparisis family was. that is absolutely as though you had asked me what the nobody family was, replied m. de charlus. my aunt married, for love, a m thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself marquis de villeparisis. it did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! what his reason was i cannot tell; i suppose he was actually a monsieur de villeparisis, a gentleman born at villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside paris. my aunt tried to make out that there was such a marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; i cant tell you why. when one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms. mme. de villeparisis being merely mme. thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when i had seen the composite nature of her party. i felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. now that she had become once again what i had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. she did not cease to be charming to us all. i went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. but i had never any impression that she belonged to the faubourg saint-germain, and if i had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom i should have applied. at present, went on m. de charlus, by going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesnt concern me, indeed i can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving, he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. but the choice of your men friends is more important. eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. wait, now, my nephew saint-loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. as far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that i am sufficient. and really when alls said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that i know of. at any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows. i did not know the meaning of this slang word renter; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. people in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. a proof of innocence in their eyes. but they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. he is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious. i could not help smiling at this epithet serious, to which the intonation that m. de charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of virtuous, of steady, as one says of a little shop-girl that she is serious. at this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. m. de charlus instantly stopped him. the driver began to argue. which way are you going? yours. this surprised me, for m. de charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps. well, i dont want to get up on the box. dyou mind if i stay down here? no; but you must put down the hood. well, think over my proposal, said m. de charlus, preparing to leave me, i give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. i repeat, i shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, i must say, to furnish. but in the course of my life i have been so often taken in by appearances that i never wish to trust them again. damn it, its the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure i should know into what hands it is going to pass. very well, bear in mind what im offering you; you are like hercules (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. hallo! he turned to the cabman, havent you put the hood down? ill do it myself. i think, too, id better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in. he jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off. as for myself, no sooner had i turned in at our gate than i found the pendant to the conversation which i had heard exchanged that afternoon between bloch and m. de norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. this was a dispute between our butler, who believed in dreyfus, and the guermantes, who was an anti-dreyfusard. the truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival leagues, the patrie franaise and the droits de lhomme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. m. reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against france, according to some) that the world has ever seen. in two years he replaced a billot by a clemenceau ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the ministry of war. perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. when we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. the case of the guermantes butler and our own was peculiar. the waves of the two currents of dreyfusism and anti-dreyfusism which now divided france from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. when you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. the two butlers whom i heard arguing as i came in furnished an exception to the rule. ours let it be understood that dreyfus was guilty, the guermantes butler that he was innocent. this was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the dukes butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. the dukes butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the devils isle of an innocent man. the porter looked on. i had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the guermantes household. i went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. for some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. it is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. but to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. my grandmothers attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. when the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. if the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. these can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: ill? youre sure its not what they call a diplomatic illness? he tried to soothe his patients restlessness by a milk diet. but incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). for, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years time. so that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. cottard had told us to take her temperature. a thermometer was fetched. throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. it seemed dead. the glass reed was slipped into my grandmothers mouth. we had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. we found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmothers mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. for the first time we felt some anxiety. we shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patients fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmothers lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. we had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. we made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: very well; i have nothing to say; if its like that you may pass, this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. but sullenly she seemed to be saying: what use will that be to you? since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. and then she will grow tired of telling me, i know her; get along with you. this wont last for ever. and then youll be a lot better off. thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earths first inhabitant  long anterior to the creation of thinking man  she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. in a moment a trampled python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. and she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. meanwhile the thermometer, like a weird sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of dr. du boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. but ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. so, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind i gave dr. du boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other mens perceives the truth. i knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. ah! i dont know about that. its quite possible, put in franoise, who was in the room and heard charcots name, as she heard du boulbons, for the first time but this in no way prevented her from saying its possible. her possibles, her perhapses, her i dont knows were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. one wanted to say to her: naturally you dont know, since you havent the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether its possible or not; you know nothing about it. anyhow, you cant say now that you dont know what charcot said to du boulbon. you do know because we have just told you, and your perhapses and possibles dont come in, because its a fact. in spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as i knew that du boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, i begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. what decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. in vain might she answer us in the words of mme. de svigns letter on mme. de la fayette: everyone said she was mad not to wish to go out. i said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: mme. de la fayette is not mad! and i stuck to that. it has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out. du boulbon when he came decided against  if not mme. de svign, whom we did not quote to him  my grandmother, at any rate. instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about bergotte. i should think so, indeed, hes magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. but which of his books do you prefer? indeed! well, perhaps that is the best after all. in any case it is the best composed of his novels. claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most? i supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. but afterwards i realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmothers memory was in good order. as though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (his voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. and under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.) you will be quite well, madame, on the day  when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day  on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. you tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out? but, sir, i have a temperature. he laid a finger on her wrist. not just now, at any rate. besides, what an excuse! dont you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102? but i have a little albumen as well. you ought not to know anything about that. you have what i have had occasion to call mental albumen. we have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. for one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as i am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. a belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. do you imagine, madame, that i needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if i may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you? your grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the champs-elyses, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little, said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting dr. du boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. the doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: go to the champs-elyses, madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. the laurel you will find health-giving. it purifies. after he had exterminated the serpent python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that apollo made his entry into delphi. he sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. so you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, i will add  what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value  the most beautiful of antiseptics. in as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. thus it was with the superior smile of a parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that dr. du boulbon said to my grandmother: probably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect. on the contrary, sir, when the wind blows i can never sleep at all. but doctors are touchy people. ach! muttered du boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmothers sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. he had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a superior person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity. my mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from bergottes friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week. you see, madame, i didnt know that, and yet i could have told you. but, sir, i am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed, said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctors theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis. why, naturally, madame, you cannot have all the forms of  if youll excuse my saying so  mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. yesterday i visited a home for neurasthenics. in the garden, i saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. on my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: you see, doctor, i am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; i have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while i was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. if i move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, i am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis. which he would, in fact, have done. youre a fine specimen of neurasthenia, thats what you are, i told him. and do you know what argument he advanced to prove that i was mistaken? it was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. he prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. you must not be offended by the comparison, madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. that poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that i know. submit to being called a neurotic. you belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. all the greatest things we know have come to us from neurotics. it is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. we enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, madame, he added with a smile at my grandmother, for confess now, when i came into the room, you were not feeling very confident you thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. and you were not mistaken; they were there. neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. there is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. it will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. if it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? no, no; you mustnt think im making fun of your sufferings. i should not undertake to heal them unless i understood them thoroughly. and, well, they say theres no good confession unless its mutual. i have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. what is more, he added, raising a solemn forefinger, there can be no great scientist either. i will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, i wont say a good doctor, but i do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. in nervous pathology a doctor who doesnt say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. i, madame, i do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, i have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but i can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. and in that home where i found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, i had gone to secure a room, for  this is between ourselves  i spend my holidays there looking after myself when i have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people. but do you want me to take a cure like that, sir? came to a frightened voice from my grandmother. it is not necessary, madame. the symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom i appoint as your doctor from now onwards. that is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. even if i knew how to cure you of that, i should take good care not to. all i need do is to control it. i see on your table there one of bergottes books. cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. well, i might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. but those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. no; i have nothing to say against your nervous energy. all i ask is that it should listen to me; i leave you in its charge. it must reverse its engines. the force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. you neednt tell me that you are fatigued. fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. begin by not thinking it. and if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadnt it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what m. de talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called imaginary health. see, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, i have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. well, madame, i shall now bid you good-day. when, after seeing dr. du boulbon to the door, i returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, i felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, i felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; i tried to speak to mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, i stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that i knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. franoise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. she was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. it had required the duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. for she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal place if only she didnt listen to stories. during the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmothers illness and to inquire for news of her. saint-loup had written to me: i do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. but i should not be speaking the truth were i to say to you, even out of politeness, that i shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal. but some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the champs-elyses, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. i had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. when my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey dr. du boulbons orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the champs-elyses. it would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where i should meet them later; and i should still be in time, if i made haste, to take the train with them to ville davray. when the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. but my mother, acting on du boulbons instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. she was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. the sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. as franoise had not had time to send a tube to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. she very kindly consented, however, to call first at jupiens, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. returning at that moment from my morning walk i accompanied her into the shop. is it your young master who brings you here, jupien asked franoise, is it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both? for all his want of education, jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as m. de guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. with franoise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. having obstinately refused to let mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that i knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, i felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that i had an appointment with my friends and was dining at ville davray. in my impatience i finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after i had twice been told that she was just ready. at last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as i was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage. oh, dear, if youre going to meet your friends i ought to have put on another cloak. i look rather poverty-stricken in this one. i was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. when we left the cab at the end of the avenue gabriel, in the champs-elyses, i saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which i had once waited for franoise. the same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to franoises marquise when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, i climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. at the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the marquise, at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. but i do not suppose that she recognised me. the park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side. so youre still here? he was saying. you dont think of retiring? and what have i to retire for, sir? will you kindly tell me where i shall be better off than here, where i should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? and then theres all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little paris, i call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything thats going on. just to give you an example, theres one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; hes a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. very well, sir, she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, for the last eight years, do you follow me, every day god has made, regularly on the stroke of three hes been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. there was one day he didnt come. i never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden i said to myself: why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps hes dead! and that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, i get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. and so i was very glad when i saw him come in again next day, and i said to him, i did: i hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, sir? then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and hed been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadnt been able to come. he had that really sad look, you know, people have when theyve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. you could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. i did what i could to make him feel at home. i said to him: y mustnt let go of things, sir. just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow. the marquise resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god. and besides, she went on, i choose my customers, i dont let everyone into my little parlours, as i call them. and doesnt the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? such friendly customers i have; theres always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are. the thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape  or of being condemned only by default  from an adverse judgment, i moved towards the exit. but it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the marquise, thinking that i was bored, turned to me. you wouldnt like me to open a little place for you? and, on my declining: no? youre sure you wont? she persisted, smiling. well, just as you please. youre welcome to it, but i know quite well, not having to pay for a thing wont make you want to do it if you dont want to. at this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. but she did not belong to the marquises world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her: ive nothing disengaged, maam. will they be long? asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat. well, maam, if youll take my advice, youll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and ive only one closet; the others are out of order. not much money there, she explained when the other had gone. its not the sort we want here, either; theyre not clean, dont treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. im not sorry to lose her penny. finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, i beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the marquise would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. i expected her to begin: i am afraid ive kept you waiting; i hope youll still be in time for your friends, but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, i was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her i noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. i was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. i studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch. i was afraid you were feeling sick, grandmamma; are you feeling better now? i asked her. probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer. i heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper, she told me. could anything have been more typical of the guermantes, or the verdurins and their little circle? heavens, what fine language she put it all in! and she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special marquise, mme. de svign: as i listened to them i thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell. such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. but i guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again. come! i said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, since your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? i dont want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the champs-elyses. i didnt like to suggest it, because of your friends, she replied. poor boy! but if you dont mind, i think it would be wiser. i was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words. come! i said to her sharply, you mustnt tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, its silly; wait till we get home. she smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. she had realised that there was no need to hide from me what i had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke. we made our way back along the avenue gabriel, through the strolling crowd. i left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. she, in whose heart i always placed myself when i had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, i was obliged to keep from her what i thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. i could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. she had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, i had entrusted for all time to her keeping. she was not yet dead. i was already alone. and even those allusions which she had made to the guermantes, to mme. de svign, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be. well, sir, i dont like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. you surely have a doctor of your own. i cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. its a question of professional etiquette     just as i was signalling to a cabman, i had caught sight of the famous professor e  almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the avenue gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. but he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him. but, sir, i am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what i am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what i am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hours time, when i have taken her home. call at your house! really, sir, you must not expect me to do that. i am dining with the minister of commerce. i have a call to pay first. i must change at once, and to make matters worse i have torn my coat and my other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. i beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. you dont know how the lift works; one cant be too careful. getting that buttonhole made means more delay. well, as i am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once i will see her. but i warn you that i shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more. i had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which professor e-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so. we may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death  or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again  may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. you make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a months time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the champs-elyses. perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death  in this kind of first contact with death  because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. a good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. a drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six oclock, as we came home from the champs-elyses, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. legrandin, making his way towards the place de la concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. i, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. my grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: what does it matter? it is not of the least importance. yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when i was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the avenue gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. but would that have been really true? the seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue  for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium  has no need of energy. but in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle. and if legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. she had appeared to them, although i was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when i looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the champs-elyses, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. i have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. she had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. but it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a sociable neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. a terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. a woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. the sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. she does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. is he a criminal? one morning, she can no longer hear him. he has gone. ah! if it were only for ever! in the evening he has returned. what are his plans? her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. or rather it is not the mistresss part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. they are only third parties. the person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us. i helped my grandmother into professor es lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. but there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. he had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. his examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. he continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. he even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though i should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. i then remembered that m. fallires, the president of the senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the presidency of the republic. my confidence in my grandmothers prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as i was recalling the example of m. fallires, i was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the professors jokes. after which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. i waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth. there is not the slightest hope, he informed me. it is a stroke brought on by uraemia. in itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. i need not tell you that i hope i am mistaken. anyhow, you have cottard, youre in excellent hands. excuse me, he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. i told you, im dining with the minister of commerce, and i have a call to pay first. ah! life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age. and he graciously offered me his hand. i had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. the maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. this would take another ten minutes. the professor continued to storm while i stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. each of us is indeed alone. we started for home. the sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some pompeian terra-cotta. at length we arrived at the house. i made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. i told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. as soon as i began to speak, my mothers face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that i realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. she asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when franoise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. she came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. my grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at mamma. i had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. i had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her god, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferers face. perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. so they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes. meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmothers altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was franoise. not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mothers arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh. when, thanks to the faultless ministrations of franoise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. and at once she was anxious not to fail mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass. well, my child, she began, taking my mothers hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. so this is all the pity you shew your mother! you look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing! then for the first time my mothers eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil: mamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that. and embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. my grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. but she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused franoise unjustly of not doing her bed properly). by a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide. my mother and i (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of franoise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that andre was too sorry for al-bertine to be really fond of her. the same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. in a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours. franoise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. and if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still franoise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. she neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. it was true that she had brought from combray an extremely exalted idea of everyones duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should fail us. this doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing  however little they might previously have sought to oblige  to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. but at combray franoise had contracted also  and had brought with her to paris  the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. the sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. and at this moment when my grandmother was so ill franoises duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. she would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. and so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butlers example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. he sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. naturally he expected these to dazzle them. but as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. so much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from lamartine, just as he might have said who laughs last, laughs longest! or merely how are you keeping? to ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. the blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. and the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. the savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. on certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. in this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moments reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: advance eastwards. medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. but, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. to a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. we can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. his nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. one consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. when my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: oh, its dreadful! but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or  an alternative stratagem  repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard. oh! my dear, its dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; i am crying with rage at your orders. but she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs. there is nothing wrong. im complaining because im not lying very comfortably. i feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, i knocked myself against the wall. and my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said: no, no, mamma dear, we wont let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling  no, youre not to move. and stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. my grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to mammas. it was so altered that probably had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. her features, like the clay in a sculptors hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. this business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmothers face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. the veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. but the whole task was not yet accomplished. next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered. in one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist x -he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. people say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as franoise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. the specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like aeoluss bottle. my grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. and we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. according to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. to each of us he said: i should like to have another look at that little cornea. dont put it off too long. i can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle. we were, of course, thinking of something quite different. and yet we asked ourselves: get rid of what? in a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. for by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. each of us had his or her catarrh. and when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. he had examined us at a moment when we were already ill. my grandmothers illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. and the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmothers room. summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave combray. they had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalids bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. mme. sazerat wrote to mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me. he had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. but formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. for he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. according to another version, he had a tumour. he grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, i believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the man with the little beard whom i had seen so alert, not very long since. he was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed. but at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when mme. swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. the general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. but it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards renown. a dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. the effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. in the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by glory. but for bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. he existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. he was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers. the visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for i had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. a mans work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. in the books of bergotte which i constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. all the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. but a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that i could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. he would say, for instance: the hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads (and so far it was simple, i followed him smoothly along those roads) which started every five minutes from briand and claudel. at that point i ceased to understand, because i had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. only i felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but i myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. i would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which i would see things in their novel relations. and each time, after i had got about halfway through the sentence, i would fall back again, as later on, when i joined the army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the bridge-ladder. i felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. and from then onwards i felt less admiration for bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. there was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was renoir. people of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. but in so saying they forget the element of time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before renoir was hailed as a great artist. to succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. the course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. when it is at an end the operator says to us: now look! and, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are renoirs, those renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. the carriages, too, are renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. it will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent. this writer who had taken bergottes place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations  perfectly coherent  which my mind was not trained to follow. the fact that it was always at the same point that i felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that i had always to make. moreover, when once in a thousand times i did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what i saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which i had found long ago in reading bergotte, only more delightful. i reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which i was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by bergotte himself. until i was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in homers day, and science with its continuous progress. perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was i to know that in twenty years time, when i should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned bergotte? i spoke to the latter of the new writer. he gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for bloch. from that moment my friends features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and i no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. if bergotte had decried him to me it was less, i fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. he read scarcely anything. the bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. he had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. his reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. he led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. however, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than i should once have found it, i felt no compunction for that. he was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. i do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. he would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might  very rarely  talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. it did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. and every day she reminded me: see that you dont forget to thank him nicely. we had also  a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painters mistress  a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from mme. cottard. she came to offer us her waiting-woman, or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would scour the country for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. she assured us that the professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. we shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands. offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the hereditary grand duke of luxembourg. i had met him at balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the princesse de luxembourg, being himself at that time merely comte de nassau. he had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another luxembourg princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. whereupon the grand duke of luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew nassau, had obtained the approval of his chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. as with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the brides fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. i remembered this comte de nassau as one of the most striking young men i had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. i was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmothers illness, and mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mothers expressions: svign would not have put it better. on the sixth day mamma, yielding to my grandmothers entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. i should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) franoise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. in spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. she would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. but word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by jupien. this man had been ordered to come before my grandmothers illness. it seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. but franchises code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmothers condition ceased at once to matter. when, after waiting a quarter of an hour, i lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, i found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. franoise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. a typical combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which franoise extended even to foreign politics. people foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. a thousand times over franoise told the gardener at combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. yet, when the russo-japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the poor russians, since, she reminded us, were allianced to them. she felt this abstention to be not quite polite to nicholas ii, who had always said such nice things about us; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from jupien, knowing that it would upset her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at deaths door, the same meanness of which she considered france guilty in remaining neutral with regard to japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble. luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of franoises daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. to the regular stock of advice which people at combray gave to the family of an invalid: you havent tried taking him away for a little    the change of air, you know    pick up an appetite    etc? she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of peoples heads: she ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first. she did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were radical. as for franoise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. she had, in the south of france, some cousins  relatively well-to-do  whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. now all this seemed to franoise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a place in the country. they themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. they had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. the ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. the father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. franoise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmothers sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre. there came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmothers eyes. for some days she could not see at all. her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. and i gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. for several days my grandmother was deaf. and as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. but the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with ones eyes. finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. we were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said. and now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. when she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. she made no effort to think. then came a state of perpetual agitation. she was incessantly trying to get up. but we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. one day when she had been left alone for a moment i found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window. at balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery  so obscure, for all that  of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom. we were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders. the look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman.    by dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, franoise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. she armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de cologne, a wrapper. it cant hurt madame amde, she said to herself, if i just comb her; nobodys ever too ill for a good combing. in other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. but when i came into the room i saw between the cruel hands of franoise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. i felt that the moment at which franoise would have finished her task was approaching, and i dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: that is enough, for fear of her disobeying me. but i did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, franoise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. i was glad for the moment that i had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. but, alas, when, a moment later, i leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me. according to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. it must be relieved in some way. cottard was in two minds. franoise hoped at first that they were going to apply clarified cups. she looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. even if she had said scarified instead of clarified she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under s than under c; she did indeed say clarified but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) esclarified. cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. when, a few hours later, i went into my grandmothers room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of medusa. but in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face i saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. she realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that i should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand. i knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. i knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. and so it infuriated me to hear franoise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: oh, look at the little beasties running about on madame. this was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. but my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her. alas! no sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. i was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, franoise was constantly disappearing. the fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. in the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of trying-on. a few days later, when i was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. with that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others: forgive me for disturbing your sleep, she said to me. i was not asleep, i answered as i awoke. i said this in good faith. the great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. the tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. but then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. a little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. and when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: i was asleep. in a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on: my poor boy, you have only your papa and mamma to help you now. we went into the sickroom. bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. the eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. all this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. but if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? yes, i could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing. mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmothers forehead. it was the only thing that refreshed her, thought mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. but now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. the news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. one of those extra helps whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the duc de guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: i could not escape him. i have just, my dear sir, heard your tragic news. i should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father. i made the excuse that i could not very well disturb him at the moment. m. de guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. but he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. as a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready. have you sent for dieulafoy? no? that was a great mistake. and if you had only asked me, i would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the duchesse de chartres before now. you see, i set myself above a princess of the blood. however, in the presence of death we are all equal, he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the duchesse de chartres would not be in very good taste. this advice did not in the least surprise me. i knew that, in the guermantes set, the name of dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were quite the best in their respective lines. and the old duchesse de mortemart neguermantes (i never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a duchess, one almost invariably says: the old duchess of so-and-so or, alternatively, in a delicate watteau tone, if she is still young: the little duchess of so-and-so,) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: dieulafoy, dieulafoy! as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: poir blanche, or for small pastry rebattet, rebattet. but i was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for dieulafoy. at this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find m. de guermantes. i should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. but convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although i defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of sir, sir, sir, dragged me across to mamma, saying: will you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother? letting go a little as he came to the last word. and it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. there was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. he apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of m. de guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of saint-loup who had arrived in paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. i say, this is a piece of luck! cried the duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. saint-loup was not sorry, i fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. he left the house, carried off by his uncle who  having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to doncires on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. upon my soul, if anybody had told me i had only to cross the courtyard and i should find you here, i should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend m. bloch would say, its a regular farce. and as he disappeared down the stairs with robert whom he held by the shoulder: all the same, he went on, its quite clear i must have touched the hangmans rope or something; i do have the most astounding luck. not that the duc de guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. but he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: this is a very painful occasion, after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a lift in their carriage when it is time to go home. the duc de guermantes, while congratulating himself on the good wind that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception  natural as it was  that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had absent fits during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite all there. at the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what i was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly affected by the sad event. but he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of mammas sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if i was not doing anything to distract her. a half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom i had never seen, had telegraphed to austria, where the head of his order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalids face. at one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this clerics grief began to upset me, and i looked at him tenderly. he appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. he joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that i would then cease to watch him, left, as i observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. and at the moment when my gaze left his face, i saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. he was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. he saw that i was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. i have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. it was tacitly agreed that i had not noticed that he was spying on me. in the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten? the doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. my mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. i had left the room for a few minutes. when i returned i found myself face to face with a miracle. accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. i soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that i had heard before leaving the room. perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmothers breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow. franoise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art  as simple as that need was futile  of giving it expression. regarding my grandmothers case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. and all that she could do was to repeat: it makes me feel all queer, in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: its like a load on my stomach, sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at combray (to which this young parisian now referred as the cambrousse and where she felt herself growing ptrousse, in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, franoise felt, to be a superb spectacle. knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. she knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. she was determined at least to go over it all with him on his return. for several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. he was always sent for in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. i could tell already that mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions: promise me that you wont come to-morrow. please, for her sake. at any rate, you wont go all the way. its what she would have wished. but there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive at the house, by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of no flowers by request. and before attending everything he had always attended to everything, which entitled him to the formula: we dont know how to thank you. whats that? came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father. nothing, answered the cousin. i was just saying that id heard from combray this morning. the weather is appalling down there, and here weve got too much sun. yet the barometer is very low, put in my father. where did you say the weather was bad? asked my grandfather. at combray. ah! im not surprised; whenever its bad here its fine at combray, and vice versa. good gracious! talking of combray, has anyone remembered to tell legrandin? yes, dont worry about that, its been done, said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having remembered it. at this point my father hurried from the room. i supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. it was simply that dr. dieulafoy had just arrived. my father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. we had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. dr. dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. the mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: m. dieulafoy, one imagined oneself at a play by molire. to the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. a face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. in the sable majesty of his frock coat the professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. at the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the duc de guermantes who was the great gentleman having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom i felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: professor dieulafoy. but already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. he had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurers nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity  which was increased rather  of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. the slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. for he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. that eminent man is no longer with us. other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. but the capacity in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. mamma had not even noticed m. dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. i remember (and here i anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: old norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, hell be so gratified if you do, my mother, when the ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. a couple of days earlier  to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying  while they were watching by the body, franoise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: i believe thats her. but in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still. to return now to those last hours, you heard about the telegram her sisters sent us? my grandfather asked the cousin. yes, beethoven, they told me about it, its worth framing; still, im not surprised. my poor wife, who was so fond of them, too, said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. we mustnt blame them. theyre stark mad, both of them, as ive always said. whats the matter now; arent you going on with the oxygen? my mother spoke: oh, but then mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing. the doctor reassured her: oh, no! the effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently. it seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. the hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, but the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. the doctor stooped to feel my grandmothers pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. and the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. who knows whether, without indeed my grandmothers being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? one would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. at the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. they made me dry my eyes before i went up to kiss my grandmother. but i thought she couldnt see anything now? said my father. one can never be sure, replied the doctor. when my lips touched her face, my grandmothers hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. franoise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. remembering what the doctor had just said i tried to make her leave the room. at that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. i thrust myself hurriedly in front of franoise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. the sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. my grandmother was dead. an hour or two later franoise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. but now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. as at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. a smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmothers lips. on that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young maiden.embed"

in satires, each man, though untouch'd, complains as he were hurt; and hates such biting strains. hor. what shall i do? milonius shakes his heels in ceaseless dances, when his brain once feels the stirring fervour of the wine ascend; and that his eyes false numbers apprehend. castor his horse, pollux loves handy-fights; a thousand heads, a thousand choice delights. my pleasure is in feet my words to close, as, both our better, old lucilius does: he, as his trusty friends, his books did trust with all his secrets; nor, in things unjust, or actions lawful, ran to other men: so that the old man's life described, was seen as in a votive table in his lines: and to his steps my genius inclines; lucanian, or apulian, i know not whether, for the venusian colony ploughs either; sent thither, when the sabines were forced thence, as old fame sings, to give the place defence 'gainst such as, seeing it empty, might make road upon the empire; or there fix abode: whether the apulian borderer it were, or the lucanian violence they fear.- but this my style no living man shall touch, if first i be not forced by base reproach; but like a sheathed sword it shall defend my innocent life; for why should i contend to draw it out, when no malicious thief robs my good name, the treasure of my life? o jupiter, let it with rust be eaten, before it touch, or insolently threaten the life of any with the least disease; so much i love, and woo a general peace. but, he that wrongs me, better, i proclaim, he never had assay'd to touch my fame. for he shall weep, and walk with every tongue throughout the city, infamously sung. servius the praetor threats the laws, and urn, if any at his deeds repine or spurn; the witch canidia, that albutius got, denounceth witchcraft, where she loveth not; thurius the judge, doth thunder worlds of ill, to such as strive with his judicial will. all men affright their foes in what they may, nature commands it, and men must obey. observe with me: the wolf his tooth doth use, the bull his horn; and who doth this infuse, but nature? there's luxurious scaeva; trust his long-lived mother with him; his so just and scrupulous right-hand no mischief will; no more than with his heel a wolf will kill, or ox with jaw: marry, let him alone with temper'd poison to remove the croan. but briefly, if to age i destined be, or that quick death's black wings environ me; if rich, or poor; at rome; or fate command i shall be banished to some other land; what hue soever my whole state shall bear, i will write satires still, in spite of fear. treb. horace, i fear thou draw'st no lasting breath; and that some great man's friend will be thy death. hor. what! when the man that first did satirise durst pull the skin over the ears of vice, and make who stood in outward fashion clear, give place, as foul within; shall i forbear? did laelius, or the man so great with fame, that from sack'd carthage fetch'd his worthy name, storm that lucilius did metellus pierce, or bury lupus quick in famous verse? rulers and subjects, by whole tribes he checkt, but virtue and her friends did still protect: and when from sight, or from the judgment-seat, the virtuous scipio and wise laelius met, unbraced, with him in all light sports they shared, till their most frugal suppers were prepared. whate'er i am, though both for wealth and wit beneath lucilius i am pleased to sit; yet envy, spite of her empoison'd breast, shall say, i lived in grace here with the best; and seeking in weak trash to make her wound, shall find me solid, and her teeth unsound: 'less learn'd trebatius' censure disagree. treb. no, horace, i of force must yield to thee; only take heed, as being advised by me, lest thou incur some danger: better pause, than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws; there's justice, and great action may be sued 'gainst such as wrong men's fames with verses lewd. hor. ay, with lewd verses, such as libels be, and aim'd at persons of good quality: i reverence and adore that just decree. but if they shall be sharp, yet modest rhymes, that spare men's persons, and but tax their crimes, such shall in open court find current pass, were caesar judge, and with the maker's grace. treb. nay, i'll add more; if thou thyself, being clear, shall tax in person a man fit to bear shame and reproach, his suit shall quickly be dissolved in laughter, and thou thence set free. to the reader if, by looking on what is past, thou hast deserved that name, i am willing thou should'st yet know more, by that which follows, an apologetical dialogue; which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer i ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out (and some yet remaining) against me, and this play. wherein i take no pleasure to revive the times; but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then, and mine that neglected them ever, for, in these strifes, and on such persons, were as wretched to affect a victory, as it is unhappy to be committed with them. non annorum canities est laudanda, sed morum. scene, the author's lodgings. enter nasutus and polyposus. nas. i pray you let' s go see him, how he looks after these libels. pol. o vex'd, vex'd, i warrant you. nas. do you think so?

aut. shall i tell you? nas. yea, and ingeniously. aut. then, by the hope which i prefer unto all other objects, i can profess, i never writ that piece more innocent or empty of offence. some salt it had, but neither tooth nor gall, nor was there in it any circumstance which. in the setting down, i could suspect might be perverted by an enemy's tongue; only it had the fault to be call'd mine; that was the crime. pol. no! why, they say you tax'd the law and lawyers, captains and the players, by their particular names. aut. it is not so. i used no name. my books have still been taught to spare the persons, and to speak the vices. these are mere slanders, and enforced by such as have no safer ways to men's disgraces. but their own lies and loss of honesty: fellows of practised and most laxative tongues, whose empty and eager bellies, in the year, compel their brains to many desperate shifts, (i spare to name them, for their wretchedness fury itself would pardon). these, or such, whether of malice, or of ignorance, or itch t' have me their adversary, i know not, or all these mixt; but sure i am, three years they did provoke me with their petulant styles on every stage: and i at last unwilling, but weary, i confess, of so much trouble, thought i would try if shame could win upon 'em,' and therefore chose augustus caesar's times, when wit and area were at their height in rome, to shew that virgil, horace, and the rest of those great master-spirits, did not want detractors then, or practicers against them: and by this line, although no parallel, i hoped at last they would sit down and blush; but nothing i could find more contrary. and though the impudence of flies be great, yet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps, or, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets, that they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils, and, like so many screaming grasshoppers held by the wings, fill every ear with noise. and what? those former calumnies you mention'd. first, of the law: indeed i brought in ovid chid by his angry father for neglecting the study of their laws for poetry: and i am warranted by his own words: saepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas! maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes. and in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these: non me verbosas leges ediscere, non me ingrato voces prostituisse foro. but how this should relate unto our laws, or the just ministers, with least abuse, i reverence both too much to understand! then, for the captain, i will only speak an epigram i here have made: it is unto true soldiers. that's the lemma: mark it. strength of my country, whilst i bring to view such: as are miss-call'd captains, and wrong you, and your high names; i do desire, that thence, be nor put on you, nor you take offence: i swear by your true friend, my muse, i love your great profession which i once did prove; and did not shame it with my actions then, no more than i dare now do with my pen. he that not trusts me, having vowed thus much, but's angry for the captain, still: is such. now for the players, it is true, i tax'd them, and yet but some; and those so sparingly, as all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd, had they but had the wit or conscience to think well of themselves. but impotent, they thought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe; and much good do't them! what they have done 'gainst me, i am not moved with: if it gave them meat, or got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end. only amongst them, i am sorry for some better natures, by the rest so drawn, to run in that vile line. pol. and is this all! will you not answer then the libels? aut. no. pol. nor the untrussers? aut. neither. pol. y'are undone then. aut. with whom? pol. the world. aut. the bawd! pol. it will be taken to be stupidity or tameness in you. aut. but they that have incensed me, can in soul acquit me of that guilt. they know i dare to spurn or baffle them, or squirt their eyes with ink or urine; or i could do worse, arm'd with archilochus' fury, write iambics, should make the desperate lashers hang themselves; rhime them to death, as they do irish rats in drumming tunes. or, living, i could stamp their foreheads with those deep and public brands, that the whole company of barber-surgeon a should not take off with all their art and plasters. and these my prints should last, still to be read in their pale fronts; when, what they write 'gainst me shall, like a figure drawn in water, fleet, and the poor wretched papers be employed to clothe tobacco, or some cheaper drug: this i could do, and make them infamous. but, to what end? when their own deeds have mark'd 'em; and that i know, within his guilty breast each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him worse than a million of these temporal plagues: which to pursue, were but a feminine humour, and far beneath the dignity of man. nas. 'tis true; for to revenge their injuries, were to confess you felt them. let them go, and use the treasure of the fool, their tongues, who makes his gain, by speaking worst of beat. pol. o, but they lay particular imputations aut. as what? pol. that all your writing is mere railing. aut. ha? if all the salt in the old comedy should be so censured, or the sharper wit of the bold satire termed scolding rage, what age could then compare with those for buffoons? what should be said of aristophanes, persius, or juvenal, whose names we now so glorify in schools, at least pretend it?- have they no other? pol. yes; they say you are slow, and scarce bring forth a play a year. aut. 'tis true. i would they could not say that i did that! there' s all the joy that i take in their trade, unless such scribes as these might be proscribed th' abused theatres. they would think it strange, now, a man should take but colts-foot for one day, and, between whiles, spit out a better poem than e'er the master of art, or giver of wit, their belly, made. yet, this is possible, if a free mind had but the patience, to think so much together and so vile. but that these base and beggarly conceits should carry it, by the multitude of voices, against the most abstracted work, opposed to the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout! o, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul to rive his stained quill up to the back, and damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire, things that were born when none but the still night and his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes, were not his own free merit a more crown unto his travails than their reeling claps. this 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips, and apts me rather to sleep out my time, than i would waste it in contemned strifes with these vile ibides, these unclean birds, that make their mouths their clysters, and still purge from their hot entrails. but i leave the monsters to their own fate. and, since the comic muse hath proved so ominous to me, i will try if tragedy have a more kind aspect; her favours in my next i will pursue, where, if i prove the pleasure but of one, so he judicious be, he shall be alone a theatre unto me; once i'll say to strike the ear of time in those fresh strains, as shall, beside the cunning of their ground, give cause to some of wonder, some despite, and more despair, to imitate their sound. i, that spend half my nights, and all my days, here in a cell, to get a dark paleface, to come forth worth the ivy or the bays, and in this age can hope no other grace- leave me! there's something come into my thought, that must and shall be sung high and aloof, safe from the wolfs black jaw, and the dun ass's hoof nas. i reverence these raptures, and obey them.

but the laugh was out, was at large was heard by the pupil twinned to her double desk  you might also likerosemary beth  the brace on whose jiggly teeth couldnt restrain the gulping giggle she gave which caused miss dunn to spin round. perhaps she said, we can all share the joke? but emily jane had scrunched and dropped the note with the joke to the floor and kicked it across to jennifer kay who snorted and toed it across to marjorie may who spluttered and heeled it backwards to jessica kate. girls! by now, every girl in the form had started to snigger or snicker or titter or chuckle or chortle till the classroom came to the boil with a brothy mirth. girls! miss dunns shrill voice scraped top g and only made matters worse five minutes passed in a cauldron of noise no one could seem to stop. each tried holding her breath or thinking of death or pinching her thigh, only to catch the eye of a pal a crimson, shaking, silent girl, and explode through the noise in a cackling sneeze. thank you! please! screeched miss dunn, clapping her hands as though she applauded the choir theyd become a percussion of trills and whoops filling the room like birds in a cage. but then came a triple rap at the door and in stalked miss fife, head of maths whose cold equations of eyes scanned the desks for a suitable scapegoat. stand up, geraldine ruth geraldine ruth got to her feet, a pale girl, a girl who looked, in the stale classroom light, like a sketch for a girl, a first draft to be crumpled and crunched and tossed away like a note. she cleared her throat raising her eyes, water and sky, to look at miss fife the girls who were there that day never forgot how invisible crayons seemed to colour in geraldine ruth, white face to puce, mousey hair suddenly gifted with health and youth, and how  as miss fife demanded what was the meaning of this  her lips split from the closed bud of a kiss to the daisy chain of a grin and how then she yodelled a laugh with the full, open, blooming rose of her throat a flower of merriment. whats the big joke? thundered miss fife as miss dunn began again to clap, as gargling geraldine ruth collapsed in a heap on her desk, as the rest of the class hollered and hooted and howled. miss fife strode on sharp heels to the blackboard, snatched up a finger of chalk and jabbed and slashed out a word. silence. but the class next door fourth years learning the beaufort scale with miss batt could hear the commotion. miss batt droned on  nought, calm; one, light air; two, light breeze; three gentle    four, moderate    five, fresh    six, strong breeze; seven, moderate gale    stephanie fay started to laugh whats so amusing, stephanie fay? barked miss batt whats so amusing? echoed unwitting miss dunn on the other side of the wall. precisely whats so amusing? chorused miss fife. the fourth years shrieked with amazed delight and one wag angela joy, popped her head in the jaws of her desk and bellowed whats so amusing? whats so amusing? into its musty yawn. the third form guffawed afresh at the sound of the fourth and the noise of the two combined was heard by the first form, trying to get shakespeare by heart to the beat of the ruler of mrs mackay. dont look at your books, look at me. after three. friends romans, countrymen    whats so amusing? rapped out mrs mackay as the first years chirruped and trilled like baby birds in a nest at a worm; but she heard for herself, appalled, the chaos coming in waves through the wall and clipped to the door. uproar. and her head of lower school! it was then that mrs mackay made mistake number one leaving her form on its own while she went to see to the forms of miss batt and miss dunn. the moment shed gone, the room blossomed with paper planes ink bombs, whistles, snatches of song, and the class clown  caroline joan  stood on her desk and took up the speech where mrs mackay had left off  lend me your ears    just what the second form did in the opposite room, reciting the poets laureate for miss nadimbaba  john dryden, thomas shadwell nahum tate, nicholas rowe, laurence eusden, colley cibber william whitehead    but scattering titters and giggles like noisy confetti on reaching henry pye as carline joan belted out antonys speech in an elvis style  for brutus, uh huh huh, is an honourable man miss nadimbaba, no fan of rock n roll, could scarcely believe her ears, deducing at once that mrs mackay was not with her class. she popped an anxious head outside her door. anarchy roared in her face like a tropical wind. the corridor clock was at four the last bell rang. although they would later regret it the teachers, taking their cue from wits-end mrs mackay allowed the chuckling, bright-eyed, mirthful girls to go home, reprimand-free, each woman privately glad that the dark afternoon was over and done the chalky words rubbed away to dance as dust on the air, the dates, the battles, the kings and queens the rivers and tributaries, poets, painters, playwrights politicos, popes    but they all agreed to make it quite clear in tomorrows assembly that foolish behaviour  even if only the once  wasnt admired or desired at stafford girls high. above the school, the moon was pinned like a monitors badge to the sky miss dunn was the first to depart, wheeling her bicycle through the gates, noticing how the sky had cleared, a tidy diagram of the plough directly above. she liked it this cold, her breath chiffoning out behind as she freewheeled home down the hill, her mind emptying itself of geography of mountains and seas and deserts and forests and capital cities. her small terraced house looked she thought, like a sleeping face. she roused it each evening, kisses of light on its cheeks from her lamps, the small talk of cutlery, pots and pans as she cooked, sweet silver steam caressing the shy rooms of her home. miss dunn live alone so did miss batt, in a flat on the edge of the park near the school; though this evening miss fife was coming for supper. the two were good friends and miss fife liked to play on miss batts small piano after the meal and the slowly shared carafe of wine music and maths! johann sebastian bach! miss batt an all-rounder, took out her marking  essays on henry viii and his wives from the fifth  while miss fife gave herself up to minuet in g. in between catherine howard and catherine parr, miss batt glanced across at fifis straight back as she played, each teacher conscious of each womans silently virtuous love. nights like this twice a week, after school, for them both, seemed enough mrs mackay often gave miss nadimbaba a lift as they both, by coincidence, lived on mulberry drive  mrs mackay with her husband of twenty-five grinding childless years; miss nadimbaba sharing a house with her elderly aunt. neither had ever invited the other one in, although each would politely enquire after her colleagues invisible half. mrs mackay watched miss nadimbaba open her purple door and saw a cat rubbing itself on her calf. she pulled away from the kerb, worrying whether mr mackay would insist on fish for his meal. then he would do his crossword: mr mackay calling out clues  kind of court for a bounder (8)  while she passed him roget, brewer, pears, the oed the women teachers of england slept in their beds their shrewd or wise or sensible heads safe vessels for othellos jealousy, the wife of baths warm laugh the phases of the moon, the country code; for roman numerals, greek alphabets, french verbs; for foreign currencies and latin roots, for logarithms, tables quotes; the meanings of current calamo and fiat lux and stet miss dunn dreamed of a freezing white terrain where slowly moving elephants were made of ice miss nadimbaba dreamed she knelt to kiss miss barrett on her couch and she, miss nadimbaba, was browning saying beloved, be my wife    and then a dog began to bark and she woke up. miss batt dreamed of miss fife    morning assembly  the world like quink outside the teachers perched in a solemn row on the stage the fifth and sixth forms clever and tall, miss fife at the school piano, the head herself, doctor bream at the stand  was a serious affair. jerusalem hung in the air till the last of miss fifes big chords wobbled away. yesterday, intoned doctor bream the lower school behaved in a foolish way, sniggering for the most of the late afternoon. she glared at the girls through her pince-nez and paused for dramatic effect but the first and second and third and fourth forms started to laugh, each girl trying to swallow it down till the sound was like distant thunder, the opening chord of a storm. miss dunn and miss batt, miss nadimbaba and mrs mackay leapt to their feet as one, grim-faced the fifth form hooted and howled. miss fife, oddly disturbed crashed down fistfuls of furious notes on the yellowing keys the sixth forms, upper and lower, shrieked. seora devizes sartorial, strict, slim, server teacher of spanish stalked from the stage and stilettoed sharply down to the back of the hall to chastise the fifth and sixth callaos! callaos! callaos! qudense! the whole school guffawed; their pink young lungs flowering more than they had for the hymn. el clamor! the hall was a zoo snow began falling outside as though the clouds were being slowly torn up like a rule book. a good laugh as the poet ursula fleur, who attended the school was to famously write, is feasting on air. the air that day was chomped, chewed, bitten in two, pulled apart like a wishbone, licked like a lollipop, sluiced and sucked some of the girls were almost sick. girls gulped or sipped or slurped as they savoured the joke. what joke? nobody knew. a silly joy sparkled and fizzed. tabitha rose flower monitor for the day, wet herself, wailed, wept, ran from the hall, a small human shower of rain. the bell for the start of lessons rang. somehow the school filed out in a raggedly line. the head girl, josephine june scarlet-faced from killing herself, was in for a terrible time with the head. snow iced the school like a giant cake no one on record recalls the words that were said but josephine june was stripped of the head girls badge and sash and sent to the sixth form common room to demand of the prefects how they could hope to grow to be the finest of englands daughters and mothers and wives after this mornings assemblys abysmal affair? but the crowd of girls gave a massive cheer, stamping the floor with their feet in a rebel beat and diana kim captain of sports, jumped on a chair and declared that if j.j. was no longer head girl then no one would take her place. all for one! someone yelled. and one for all! diana kim opened the window and jumped down into the snow. with a shriek, emmeline bell jumped after her followed by cackling anthea meg, melanie hope, andrea lyn j.j. herself    it was gillian tess in the fifth, being lectured by tight-lipped seora devizes on how to behave, who glanced from the first-floor window and noticed the sixth form bouncing around in the snow like girls on the moon a snowball, the size of a netball, was creaking, rolling growing under their hands. look! girls at their windows gaped it grew from a ball to the size of a classroom globe. it grew from a globe to the size of a huge balloon. miss dunn drumming the worlds highest mountains into the heads of the first years  everest, k2, kangchenjunga, lhoste, makalu 1 flung open her window and breathed in the passionate cold of the snow. a wild thought seeded itself in her head in later years, the size of the snowball rolled by the sixth grew like a legend. some claimed that the head, as it groaned past her study, thought that there might have been an eclipse ursula fleur, in her prose poem snow, wrote that it took the rest of the michaelmas term to melt. miss batt vacantly staring down as her class wrote out a list of the monarchs of england  egbert, ethelwulf, ethelbald ethelbert, ethelred, alfred, edward, athelstan, edmund eadred, eadwing, edgar    noticed the snowball, huge and alone on the hockey pitch, startlingly white in the pencil grey of the light, and thought of desire, of piano scales slowing slowing, breasts. she moaned aloud, forgetful of where she was. francesca eve echoed the moan. the class roared but that night miss batt, while she cooked for miss fife who was opening the wine with a corkscrew from the last years school trip to sienna and florence felt herself naked, electric under her tartan skirt, twin set and pearls; and later, miss fife at the piano, stroking the first notes of beethovens moonlight sonata, miss batt came behind her, placing her inked and trembling hands on her shoulders. a broken a minor chord stumbled and died. miss fife said that ludwig could only have written this piece when he was in love. miss batt pulled miss fife by the hair, turning her face around, hearing her gasp, bending down, kissing her, kissing her, kissing her essays on cardinal wolsey lay unmarked on the floor across the hushed white park, down the slush of the hill miss dunn crouched on the floor of her sitting room over a map of tibet. the whisky glass in her nervous hand clunked on her teeth, talisker sheathing her tongue in a heroines warmth. she moved her finger slowly over the map, the roof of the world. her fingers walked to nepal changing the mountain chomulungma to sagarmatha she sipped at her malt and thought about mallory, lost on everests slopes with his english air, of how hed wanted to reach the summit because it was there. she wondered whether he had. nobody knew. she was herself walking the upper slopes with the captain of sports towards the foetal shape of a sleeping man    she turned to the girl    that monday morning doctor bream, at her desk didnt yet know that the laughter of stafford girls high would not go away. but when she stood on the stage garbed in her cambridge cap and gown, and told the school to quietly stand and contemplate a fresh and serious start to the week, and closed her eyes  the hush like an air balloon tethered with ropes  a low and vulgar giggle yanked at the silence. doctor bream kept her eyes clenched, hoping that if she ignored it all would be well. clumps of laughter sprouted among the row upon row of girls. doctor bream determined and blind, started the mornings hymn. i vow to thee my country    a flushed miss fife started to play all earthly things above    the rest of the staff joined in  entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love the love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test but the girls were hysterical, watching the head queen canute, singing against the tide of their mirth their shoals, their glittering laughter. she opened her eyes  clarice maud bream, mbe, dlitt  and saw, in the giggling sea one face which seemed to her to be worse, cheekier redder and louder, than all of the rest. nigella dawn was fished by the head from her seat and made to stand on a chair on the stage. laughter drained from the hall. this girl boomed the head, will stand on this chair for as long as it takes for the school to come to its senses. silence! the whole school stood like a crowd waiting for news. the bell rang. nobody moved. nobody made a sound. minutes slinked away as nigella dawn swayed on her creaky chair. the first years stared in shame at their shoes. the heads tight smile was a tick. that, she thought, in a phrase of her mothers has put the tin lid on that. a thin high whine, a kitten wind on a wire, came from behind. the school seemed to hold its breath. nigella dawn shook on her chair the sound came again, louder. doctor bream looked to the staff miss batt had her head in her lap and was keening and rocking backwards and forwards. the noise put the head in mind of a radio dial  luxembourg, light, hilversum, welsh  as though the woman were trying to tune in to herself. miss batt flung her head back and laughed, laughed like a bride    mr and mrs mackay silently ate. she eyed him boning his fish, slicking it down to the backbone sliding the skeleton out, fastidious, deft. she spied him eat from the right of his plate to the left, ordered, precise she clenched herself for his voice. a very nice dish from the bottomless deep. bad words ran in her head like mice she wanted to write them down like crossword lights 14 across: f    17 down: f       2 down: f mr mackay reached for the oed. she bit her lip. a word for one who is given to walking by night, not necessarily in sleep. she felt her heart flare in its dark cave, hungry, blind open in its small beak. beginning with n. mrs mackay moved to the window and stared at the ravenous night. later awake in the beached boat of the marital bed, mrs mackay slid from between the sheets. her spouse whistled and whined she dressed in sweater and slacks, in boots, in her old tweed coat and slipped from the house with a tut of the front door snib her breath swaggered away like a genie popped from a flask she looked for the moon, found it, arched high over the house a raised eyebrow of light, and started to walk. the streets were empty, darkly sparkling under her feet, ribbons that tied the sleeping town like a gift. a black cat glared from a wall mrs mackay walked and walked, letting the night sigh underneath her clothes, perfume her skin; letting it in the scented night  stone, starlight, tree-sleep, rat, owl a calm rhythm measured itself in her head. noctambulist she walked for hours, till dawns soft tip rubbed, smudged erased the dark. back home, she stripped and washed and dressed for school, moving about in the kitchen till mr mackay appeared, requesting a four-minute egg from a satisfied hen. she watched him slice off the top with the side of his spoon, dip in his toast, savour the soft gold of the yolk with his neat tongue. she thought of the girls how theyd laughed now for weeks. panic nipped and salted her eyes. and later that day, walking among the giggling desks of the third, she read cleopatras lament in a shaking voice as tears shone on her cheeks: hast thou no care for me? shall i abide in this dull word, which in thy absence is no better than sty? o! see my women, the crown o the earth doth melt. my lord! o! withered is the garland of the war, the soldiers pole is falln; young boys and girls are level now with men; the odds is gone, and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon. carolann clare, trapped in a breathless crippling laugh, seriously thought she would die mrs mackay lay down her book and asked the girls to start from the top and carry on reading the play round the class she closed her eyes and seemed to drift off at her desk the voices of girls shared shakespeare, line by line, the clock over the blackboard crumbling its minutes into the dusty air from the other side of the wall, light breezes of laughter came and went. further away, from the music, room, the sound of the orchestra hooted and sneered its way through grieg miss batt, in the staffroom, marking the war of jenkins ear over and over again, put down her pen. music reminded her of miss fife. she lay her head on the table, dizzy with lust, longed for the four oclock bell, for home, for pasta and vino rosso for fifis body on hers in the single bed, for kisses that tasted of jotters, of wine. she picked up an essay and read: england went to war with spain because a seaman, robert jenkins, claimed that the spanish thought him a smuggler and cut off his ear. he showed the ear in the commons and public opinion forced the government to declare war on october 23, 1739    miss batt cursed under her breath slashing a red tick with her pen. the music had stopped. hilarity squealed and screeched in its place down the corridor miss nadimbaba was teaching the poems of yeats to the fifth when the girls in the orchestra laughed. she held in her hands the poem which made her a scribbler of verse at twelve or thirteen. the song  she was sick of the laughter at stafford girls high  of wandering aengus. she stared at the girls in her class who were starting to shake. an epidemic thats what it was. it had gone on all term. it was now the air that they breathed, teachers and girls: a giggling, sniggering gurgling, snickering atmosphere, a laughing gas that seeped under doors, up corridors, into the gym, the chemistry lab the swimming pool, into latin and spanish and french and greek into needlework, history, art, r.k., p.e., into cross-country runs into the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun miss dunn stood with her bike outside school after four scanning the silly, cackling girls for a face  diana kims the captain of sports was tall, red-haired. her green eyes stared at miss dunn and miss dunn knew. this was a girl who would scale a vertical wall of ice with her fingertips who would pitch a tent on the lip of a precipice, who would know when the light was good, when the wind was bad, when snow was powdery or hard. the girl had the stuff of heroines. diana kim walked with the teacher, pushing her bicycle for her, hearing her outline the journey, the great adventure, the climb to the mother of earth. something inside her opened and bloomed miss dunn was her destiny, fame, a strong hand pulling her higher and higher into the far tibetan clouds, into the sun    doctor bream was well aware that something had to be done laughter, it seemed, was on the curriculum. the girls found everything funny, strange; howled or screamed at the slightest thing. the headmistress prowled the school listening at classroom doors. the new teacher, mrs munro was reading the flaying of marsyas to the third: help! why are you stripping me from myself? the girls were in fits mrs munros tight voice struggled on: it was possible to count his throbbing organs and the chambers of his lungs. shrieks and squeals stabbed the air. why? at what? doctor bream snooped on. miss batt was teaching the first form the names of the nine major planets: mercury, venus, earth, mars jupiter, saturn, uranus    pandemonium hooted and whooped the grim head passed down the corridor, hearing the fifth form gargling its way through the diet of worms. she came to the honours board, the names of the old girls written in gold  head girls who had passed into legend, captains of sport who had played the game, prize-winning girls, girls whod gone on to achieve great things. members of parliament! blasts of laughter belched from the playing fields. doctor bream walked to her room and stood by her desk. her certificates preened behind glass in the wintery light. silver medals and trophies and cups gleamed in the cabinet. she went to the wall  the school photograph glinted and glowed, each face like a fingertip; the pupils straight-backed, straight-faced; the staff upright, straight-laced a warm giggle burbled outside. she flung open the door the empty corridor winked. she could hear a distant piano practising fr elise    seora devizes counting in spanish in one of the rooms  uno, dos, tres cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez, once, doce trece, catorce, quince, diez y seis, diez y siete, diez y ocho a shrill whistle blowing outside    but then a burst of hysteria came from the classroom above, rolled down the stairs exploded again the classroom below. mrs mackay frantic, hoarse, could be heard pitching portias speech over the hoots of the fourth: the quality of mercy is not strained. it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath    cackles, like gunfire, crackled and spat through the school. a cheer boomed from the gym it went on thus  through every hymn or poem, catechism logarithm, sum, exam; in every classroom, drama room to music room; on school trips to a factory or farm; from first to sixth form, dunce to academic crme de la crme day in, day out; till, towards the end of the hilary term doctor bream called yet another meeting in the staffroom determined now to solve the problem of the laughter of the girls once and for all. the staff filed in at 4.15  miss batt, miss fife, miss dunn, mrs munro, the sporty mrs lee, mrs mackay, miss nadimbaba, the heads of french and science  miss feaver, mirs kaye  seora devizes the tuneful miss aherne, the part-time drama teacher mrs prendergast. the head stood up and clapped her hands miss fife poured earl grey tea. miss dunn stood by the window staring out. miss batt burned at miss fife. mrs mackay sat down and closed her eyes. miss nadimbaba churned the closing couplet of a poem in her head. miss feaver crossed her legs and smiled at mrs lee, who twirled a squash racquet between her rosy knees. i think we all agree said doctor bream, that things are past the pale. the girls are learning nothing. disciplines completely gone to pot. id like to hear from each of you in turn. mrs mackay? mrs mackay opened her eyes and sighed. and shook her head and then she started singing: it was a lover and his lass with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonimo, that oer the green cornfield did pass, in the spring time the only pretty ring time, when birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; sweet lovers love the spring. a silence fell miss batt looked at miss fife and cleared her throat. miss fife and i are leaving at the end of term. miss dunn at the window turned. im leaving then myself. to have a crack at everest the head sank to a chair. miss nadimbaba stood. then one by one the staff resigned  to publish poetry, to live in spain, to form a tennis club, to run a restaurant in nice, to tread the boards to sing in smoky clubs, to translate ovid into current speech to study homeopathy. doctor bream was white with shock and what, she forced herself at last to say, about the girls? miss batt, slowly undressing fifi in the stockroom in her head winked at miss fife. she giggled girlishly. miss feaver laughed    small hours. the moon tracked mrs mackay as she reached the edge of the sleeping town, houses dwindling to fields, the road twisting up and away into the distant hills. she caught her mid making anagrams  grow heed, stab, rats  and forced herself to chant aloud as she walked. hedgerow. bats. star. her head cleared. the town was below her now, dark and hunched a giant husband bunched in his sleep. mrs mackay climbed on higher and higher, keeping close to the ditch, till the road snaked into a long s then levelled out into open countryside. shore love, steer, low, master, night loom, riven use, no. horse. vole trees. owl. stream. moonlight. universe. on. wed, loop, wand drib, tiles, pay thaw, god. dew. pool. dawn. bird. stile. pathway dog. she arrived at the fringe of a village as morning broke miss batt held miss fife in her arms at dawn, the small room chaste with new light. miss fife began to talk in her sleep  the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. miss batt slid down nuzzled her breastbone, her stomach, kissed down, kissed down down to the triangle. the tutting bedside clock counted to five. they woke again at seven, stupid with love everything they knew  the brightest stars, sirius, canopus alpha centauri, vega; the roman emperors, claudius nero, galba, otho, vitellius; musical terms, allegro, calando crescendo, glissando; mathematics, the value of pi prime numbers, cantors infinities  only a jumble of words a jumble of words. a long deep zero groaned from miss fife miss dunn took out her list and checked it again her class was sniggering its way through a test on britains largest lakes she mouthed her list like a prayer: socks, mittens, shirt, leggings hat, face mask, goggles, harness, karabiners, ice screws, pitons helmet, descender, ascender, loops, slings, ice axe, gaiters crampons, boots, jacket, hood, trousers, water bottle, urine bottle, waste bags, sleeping bag, kit bag, head torch, batteries tent, medical kit, maps, stove, butane, radio, fixing line, rope cord, stoppers, wands, stakes and chocks and all of it twice a sprinkle of giggles made her look up. pass your test to the girl on your left to be marked. the answers are: lough neagh lower lough erne, loch lomond, loch ness, loch awe, upper lough erne    diana kim climbed and climbed in her head doctor bream read through the letter to parents then signed her name at the end. the school was to close at the end of term until further notice. a dozen resignation notes from the staff lay on her desk. the head put her head in her hands and wept a local journalist lurked at the gates. seora devizes and miss nadimbaba entered the room to say that the girls were filing into the hall for the special assembly. there was still no sign of mrs mackay. she looked at the shattered head and kipling sprang to miss nadimbabas lips: if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to server your turn long after they are gone    seora devizes joined in: persiste aun no tengas fuerza, y slo te quede la voluntad que les dice: persiste! the head got to her feet and straightened her back and so, doctor bream summed up, you girls have laughed this once great school into the ground. seora devizes plans to return to spain. cries of ol! miss batt and miss fife have resigned wolf whistles. mrs prendergast is joining the theatre royale a round of applause crashed on the boards like surf. the head stared at the laughing girls then turned and marched from the stage clipped up the polished corridor, banged through the double doors crunched down the gravel drive to the staff car park and into her car elvis, shrieked caroline joan from the hall, has left the building a cheer like an avalanche bounced off the roof. the captain of sports slipped from her seat and followed miss dunn. the girls burst into song as their mute teachers walked from the stage. till we have built jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land    the empty school creaked and sighed, its desks the small coffins of lessons, its blackboards the tombstones of learning. the books in the library stiffened and yellowed and curled. the portraits of gone headmistresses stared into space. the school groaned the tiles on its roof falling off in its sleep, its windows as white as chalk. the grass on the playing fields grew like grass on a grave. doctor bream stared from her hospital window over the fields. she could see the school bell in its tower glint in the evening sun like a tear in an eye. she turned away. postcards and get-well messages from the staff were pinned to the wall she took down a picture of everest from miss dunn: we leave camp ii tomorrow if the weather holds to climb the corridor to 21,000 feet. both coping well with altitude. the sherpas mrs mackay walked through glen strathfarrar, mad, muttering free; a filthy old pack on her back filled with scavenged loot  banana, bottle, blanket, balaclava, bread, blade, bible. she sat by a stream, filled her bottle and drank. she ate the crusts the fruit. kingfisher. eagle. heron. red deer. midge. the glen darkened and cooled like history. mrs mackay lay in the heather under her blanket, mumbling lines from lear: as mad as the vexd sea; singing aloud; crowned with rank fumitory and furrow weeds with burdocks, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, darnel syllables. syllables. sleep came suddenly, under the huge black the chuckling clever stars. the head at her window looked north to the clear night sky, to pollux and castor, capella, polaris and wondered again what could have become of mrs mackay rough lads from the town came up to the school to throw stones through the glass. miss batt and miss fife had moved to a city. they drank in a dark bar where women danced, cheek to cheek. miss batt loved miss fife till she sobbed and shook in her arms. stray cats prowled through the classrooms, lunging at mice. miss fife dreamed that the school was a huge ship floating away from land, all hands lost, steered by a ghost a woman whose face was the heads, was miss nadimbabas then mrs mackays, mrs lees, miss feavers, miss dunns mrs munros, mrs kayes, miss ahernes, seora devizes she woke in the darkness, a face over hers, a warm mouth kissing the gibberish from her lips. the school sank in her mind a black wave taking it down as she gazed at the womans face miss nadimbaba put down her pen and read through her poem the palms of her hands felt light, that talented ache she altered a verb and the line jumped on the page like a hooked fish. she needed to type it up, but the poem was done. she was dying to read it aloud to her aunt. she would open some wine in the hospital, a nurse brought warm milk and a pill to the head who stared through the bars at the blackened hulk of the school by dawn, at john ogroats, mrs mackay had finally run out of land she wrote her maiden name with a stick in the sand then walked into the sea, steady at first, step by step, till the firm waves lifted her under the arms and danced her away like a groom with a bride high above in the cold sky the seagulls, like schoolgirls, laughed higher again, a teacher fell through the clouds with a girl in her armsembed"

with yo on my goddamn rolodex not in my rolls royce i have just got no choice i'm a cuck that's not true, try my luck that's the first thing that i said when the cuck card popped up i don't watch my

get some more protein, you know that i mean what i seen, i am not a dinkle leaf little type of periwinkle that was a very poorly constructed rhyme but you know, fuck, i can find sometimes i'm behind my mind in my mouth ways you know i go gray i just get all in, i am just fallin' sometimes i say ""fuck it,"" i got a little whack nugget of rhymes and then i put it to the side and then i just rewind my mind and get these rhymes so hectic when the morning becomes eclectic shout out to kcrw support your local stations, it won't trouble you getting so mega buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega i just gotta say i don't know how to play the next word in the pile it really makes me spile but repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme so i put it at the top of the rhyme and i'm fine and i'll need some caffeine in a couple hours when i'm on the damn scene, but for now i'm fucking good as hell unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell that is coming off like a relief cap that i just had to doff i

man bringing the truth like a mailman feeling like a maniac flowing like a brainiac because you know that the way i rap is so goddamn loquacious that i'm saying it's gracious when i'm on the mic i say shit but otherwise i might not like to say but i cant just put this damn mic away i'm in my cubby hole hiding out 'cause you know that my buddy's roll it's a scout if the teacher is coming playin'

6,"the hospital, a new one recently built, with big windows, stood high up on a hill; it was glittering from the setting sun and looked as though it were on fire from inside. there was a little village below. lipa went down along the road, and before reaching the village sat down by a pond. a woman brought a horse down to drink and the horse did not drink. ""what more do you want?"" said the woman to it softly. ""what do you want?"" a boy in a red shirt, sitting at the water's edge, was washing his father's boots. and not another soul was in sight either in the village or on the hill. ""it's not drinking,"" said lipa, looking at the horse. then the woman with the horse and the boy with the boots walked away, and there was no one left at all. the sun went to bed wrapped in cloth of gold and purple, and long clouds, red and lilac, stretched across the sky, guarded its slumbers. somewhere far away a bittern cried, a hollow, melancholy sound like a cow shut up in a barn. the cry of that mysterious bird was heard every spring, but no one knew what it was like or where it lived. at the top of the hill by the hospital, in the bushes close to the pond, and in the fields the nightingales were trilling. the cuckoo kept reckoning someone's years and losing count and beginning again. in the pond the frogs called angrily to one another, straining themselves to bursting, and one could even make out the words: ""that's what you are! that's what you are!"" what a noise there was! it seemed as though all these creatures were singing and shouting so that no one might sleep on that spring night, so that all, even the angry frogs, might appreciate and enjoy every minute: life is given only once. a silver half-moon was shining in the sky; there were many stars. lipa had no idea how long she sat by the pond, but when she got up and walked on everybody was asleep in the little village, and there was not a single light. it was probably about nine miles' walk home, but she had not the strength, she had not the power to think how to go: the moon gleamed now in front, now on the right, and the same cuckoo kept calling in a voice grown husky, with a chuckle as though gibing at her: ""oy, look out, you'll lose your way!"" lipa walked rapidly; she lost the kerchief from her head... she looked at the sky and wondered where her baby's soul was now: was it following her, or floating aloft yonder among the stars and thinking nothing now of his mother? oh, how lonely it was in the open country at night, in the midst of that singing when one cannot sing oneself; in the midst of the incessant cries of joy when one cannot oneself be joyful, when the moon, which cares not whether it is spring or winter, whether men are alive or dead, looks down as lonely, too.... when there is grief in the heart it is hard to be without people. if only her mother, praskovya, had been with her, or crutch, or the cook, or some peasant! ""boo-oo!"" cried the bittern. ""boo-oo!"" and suddenly she heard clearly the sound of human speech: ""put the horses in, vavila!"" by the wayside a camp fire was burning ahead of her: the flames had died down, there were only red embers. she could hear the horses munching. in the darkness she could see the outlines of two carts, one with a barrel, the other, a lower one with sacks in it, and the figures of two men; one was leading a horse to put it into the shafts, the other was standing motionless by the fire with his hands behind his back. a dog growled by the carts. the one who was leading the horse stopped and said: ""it seems as though someone were coming along the road."" ""sharik, be quiet!"" the other called to the dog. and from the voice one could tell that the second was an old man. lipa stopped and said: ""god help you."" the old man went up to her and answered not immediately: ""good-evening!"" ""your dog does not bite, grandfather?"" ""no, come along, he won't touch you."" ""i have been at the hospital,"" said lipa after a pause. ""my little son died there. here i am carrying him home."" it must have been unpleasant for the old man to hear this, for he moved away and said hurriedly: ""never mind, my dear. it's god's will. you are very slow, lad,"" he added, addressing his companion; ""look alive! ""your yoke's nowhere,"" said the young man; ""it is not to be seen."" ""you are a regular vavila."" the old man picked up an ember, blew on itonly his eyes and nose were lighted upthen, when they had found the yoke, he went with the light to lipa and looked at her, and his look expressed compassion and tenderness. ""you are a mother,"" he said; ""every mother grieves for her child."" and he sighed and shook his head as he said it. vavila threw something on the fire, stamped on itand at once it was very dark; the vision vanished, and as before there were only the fields, the sky with the stars, and the noise of the birds hindering each other from sleep. and the landrail called, it seemed, in the very place where the fire had been. but a minute passed, and again she could see the two carts and the old man and lanky vavila. the carts creaked as they went out on the road. ""are you holy men?"" lipa asked the old man. ""no. we are from firsanovo."" ""you looked at me just now and my heart was softened. and the young man is so gentle. i thought you must be holy men."" ""are you going far?"" ""to ukleevo."" ""get in, we will give you a lift as far as kuzmenki, then you go straight on and we turn off to the left."" vavila got into the cart with the barrel and the old man and lipa got into the other. they moved at a walking pace, vavila in front. ""my baby was in torment all day,"" said lipa. ""he looked at me with his little eyes and said nothing; he wanted to speak and could not. holy father, queen of heaven! in my grief i kept falling down on the floor. i stood up and fell down by the bedside. and tell me, grandfather, why a little thing should be tormented before his death? when a grown-up person, a man or woman, are in torment their sins are forgiven, but why a little thing, when he has no sins? why?"" ""who can tell?"" answered the old man. they drove on for half an hour in silence. ""we can't know everything, how and wherefore,"" said the old man. ""it is ordained for the bird to have not four wings but two because it is able to fly with two; and so it is ordained for man not to know everything but only a half or a quarter. as much as he needs to know so as to live, so much he knows."" ""it is better for me to go on foot, grandfather. now my heart is all of a tremble."" ""never mind, sit still."" the old man yawned and made the sign of the cross over his mouth. ""never mind,"" he repeated. ""yours is not the worst of sorrows. life is long, there will be good and bad to come, there will be everything. great is mother russia,"" he said, and looked round on each side of him. ""i have been all over russia, and i have seen everything in her, and you may believe my words, my dear. there will be good and there will be bad. i went as a delegate from my village to siberia, and i have been to the amur river and the altai mountains and i settled in siberia; i worked the land there, then i was homesick for mother russia and i came back to my native village. we came back to russia on foot; and i remember we went on a steamer, and i was thin as thin, all in rags, barefoot, freezing with cold, and gnawing a crust, and a gentleman who was on the steamerthe kingdom of heaven be his if he is deadlooked at me pitifully, and the tears came into his eyes. 'ah,' he said, 'your bread is black, your days are black....' and when i got home, as the saying is, there was neither stick nor stall; i had a wife, but i left her behind in siberia, she was buried there. so i am living as a day labourer. and yet i tell you: since then i have had good as well as bad. here i do not want to die, my dear, i would be glad to live another twenty years; so there has been more of the good. and great is our mother russia!"" and again he gazed to each side and looked round. ""grandfather,"" lipa asked, ""when anyone dies, how many days does his soul walk the earth?"" ""who can tell! ask vavila here, he has been to school. now they teach them everything. vavila!"" the old man called to him. ""yes!"" ""vavila, when anyone dies how long does his soul walk the earth?"" vavila stopped the horse and only then answered: ""nine days. my uncle kirilla died and his soul lived in our hut thirteen days after."" ""how do you know?"" ""for thirteen days there was a knocking in the stove."" ""well, that's all right. go on,"" said the old man, and it could be seen that he did not believe a word of all that. near kuzmenki the cart turned into the high road while lipa went straight on. it was by now getting light. as she went down into the ravine the ukleevo huts and the church were hidden in fog. it was cold, and it seemed to her that the same cuckoo was calling still. when lipa reached home the cattle had not yet been driven out; everyone was asleep. she sat down on the steps and waited. the old man was the first to come out; he understood all that had happened from the first glance at her, and for a long time he could not articulate a word, but only moved his lips without a sound. ""ech, lipa,"" he said, ""you did not take care of my grandchild...."" varvara was awakened. she clasped her hands and broke into sobs, and immediately began laying out the baby. ""and he was a pretty child..."" she said. ""oh, dear, dear.... you only had the one child, and you did not take care enough of him, you silly girl...."" there was a requiem service in the morning and the evening. the funeral took place the next day, and after it the guests and the priests ate a great deal, and with such greed that one might have thought that they had not tasted food for a long time. lipa waited at table, and the priest, lifting his fork on which there was a salted mushroom, said to her: ""don't grieve for the babe. for of such is the kingdom of heaven."" and only when they had all separated lipa realized fully that there was no nikifor and never would be, she realized it and broke into sobs. and she did not know what room to go into to sob, for she felt that now that her child was dead there was no place for her in the house, that she had no reason to be here, that she was in the way; and the others felt it, too. ""now what are you bellowing for?"" aksinya shouted, suddenly appearing in the doorway; in honour of the funeral she was dressed all in new clothes and had powdered her face. ""shut up!"" lipa tried to stop but could not, and sobbed louder than ever. ""do you hear?"" shouted aksinya, and she stamped her foot in violent anger. ""who is it i am speaking to? go out of the yard and don't set foot here again, you convict's wife. get away."" ""there, there, there,"" the old man put in fussily. ""aksinya, don't make such an outcry, my girl.... she is crying, it is only natural... her child is dead...."" ""'it's only natural,'"" aksinya mimicked him. ""let her stay the night here, and don't let me see a trace of her here to-morrow! 'it's only natural!'..."" she mimicked him again, and, laughing, she went into the shop. early the next morning lipa went off to her mother at torguevo.embed"
